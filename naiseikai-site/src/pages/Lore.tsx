            <p>Neo-Japan is significantly larger than the Japan of our Earth due to spiritual and supernatural influences. Earth Yokais, through their connection to the land, have caused tectonic shifts and the formation of new landmasses over centuries. The continent now spans a greater area with additional islands, mountain ranges, and coastal regions that did not exist in our timeline.</p>
            <p>While many familiar prefectures and cities still exist, their locations have been adjusted to accommodate the expanded geography. Some regions have been relocated entirely, and new spiritual zones have emerged that operate outside traditional prefecture boundaries.</p>

The entirety Neo-Japan <em>technically floats</em> because under its giant mass, there are strong earth-like pillars that lift it above waters.</p>
