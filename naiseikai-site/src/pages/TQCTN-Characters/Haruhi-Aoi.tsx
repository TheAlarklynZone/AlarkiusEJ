          <p>Haruhi Aoi is the owner of Usagi Cafe, a cafe full of bunnies that she takes care of! She comes from the plains and farmlands, having owned a farm once, but was tragically destroyed in a hurricane when she was in middle school (after graduation). Somehow, most of her animals survived, one of them being her rabbits and bunnies. She later moved to Tokyo to start looking for a part-time job, and also attend high school. That was where she met her best friend, Koa Ruruka, a very skilled person.</p>
          <div className="neon-card">
            <p className="text-[10px] font-mono text-text-faint mb-2">Haruhi is a Shifter—a Bamboo Bunny. Her ears are able to pick up:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">

              <li>Frequencies - frequencies that can't be percieved by human standards.</li>
              <li>Emotions (they are empaths) - They're able to emotionally call out others on their mistakes and guide them through softness and validation. Non-judgmental creatures. Listening is their strengths.</li>
              <li>they are friendly and sociable. Extroverted.</li>

      <div>
        <h3 className="font-serif text-lg text-text mb-4">The Four Identities</h3>
        <IdentityBlock icon="😃" title="The Social Self">
          <p>Haruhi is extremely social and extroverted with everyone she knows. In fact, she's the one who would start up conversations about board games even when she invites her friends over, not just Ruruka or Hanako. She has a warm and bubbly personality. Sometimes an airhead, sometimes serious. The soft comedic relief character! Easy to get along with and cutely lovable!</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🦋" title="The Personal Self">
          <p>With her closest friends, Reina and Ruruka, she allows herself to be open with them because she trusts them. She was friends with Ruruka first when the two dated, but after breaking up due to different tastes, Ruruka allowed Haruhi to be herself, which enabled her extroverted personality out front. When she met Reina for the first time when they worked together, she became a teacher. Taught her how to cook. And when it comes to herself, alone with her thoughts….she's….Haruhi.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="The Core Self — 1">
          <p>Often reserved when she's alone. Sometimes, her thoughts about if <em>"she's enough for others"</em> would surface, but she doesn't take it too personally. She's an Empath, a quirk of being a Bamboo Bunny Yokai. She knows whether or not doing a thing is right or wrong, which is where she allows herself to distinguish what is true. Sometimes, Little Bunny Aru would invade her thoughts with anime jpops to cheer her up.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="Her Core Self with Little Bunny Aru — 2">
          <p>Little Bunny Aru. Haruhi's core daughter who resembles carefreeness and innocence in child purity. She gave birth to her (not literally) through her Earth and Plant Magic, which accidently gave Little Aru a mind of her own—(YEAH THAT'S ME LITTLE ARU THE WALL BREAKER!!!). Aru, the gremlin and chaotic side of Haruhi literally anchors her back when Haruhi tries to think wrongful thoughts. Or when she just cries randomly. Like a soft therapist but with unhinged energy. Haruhi's relationship with Aru is really wholesome. Literally a mirror of each other.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🤕" title="The Hidden Self">
          <p>Her abusive past with Asami is why she puts up her social self. She's secretly hurting because she always blames herself because of what happened between them. When the two had dated, Haruhi would always try to endure the pain she received from Asami to better understand her, but it ultimately backfires and she surrenders to Asami's cruel tactics. Each time she sees Asami with bruises, she asks why but Asami deflects that. She doesn't even want to become a burden to Haruhi, yet Haruhi doesn't even know where Asami goes for days if not weeks.</p>
          <p>However, despite the pain, she doesn't even know why Asami did all those stuff to her in the first place before they broke up over text. Asami disappeared shortly after the break-up text, which broke Haruhi's heart as of why she didn't even respond to her.</p>
          <p>Despite the pain, she dated Koa Ruruka for a while because she wanted someone to cling onto. Ruruka offered great advice and also just kindly being there for her. Haruhi had secretly fell for Ruruka hard but Ruruka's love was more of protection. Which is why Haruhi's love couldn't reach further because of the aggressive protection Ruruka gave. BUT, even with Ruruka, Haruhi still respects her, which is why they ended up as friends to besties and also platonic friends. She doesn't consider this as heartbreak though. Just mutual understanding.</p>

          <p>Haruhi, being a Yokai and a Shifter, her ears resemble that of a rabbit / bunny</p>
          <div className="neon-card">
            <p className="font-mono text-xs text-[#a8ff8a] mb-2">Patibilis Capillatura</p>
            <p>The top and bottom parts of her ears, also known as False Hair, are actual organs that help Haruhi pick up different sounds, frequencies, wavelengths and more. She can also pick up sounds like a dog whistle or a sinewave. They're that powerful.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>The false hair serves as protection from dust and other particles, which doesn't trigger the sensitivity. She can hear within a distance of five miles.</li>
              <li>She can control her hearing capabilities whenever she wants.</li>

            <p>The midrange of her ears, also known as Flexible Bamboo Ears, are really vertasile. Much like a rabbits' ears, these flexible joints help Haruhi express her feelings. If she's happy, her ears would perk straight up. If she's sad, they would droop. If she's angry, they would perk up tensely. It doesn't hurt.</p>

            <p className="font-mono text-xs text-[#a8ff8a] mb-2">🪹 Earth and Plant Magic</p>
            <p>Haruhi has forms of magic! Most of them are Elemental Magic. She can shift into her own Bunny Form at will when she wants. She is not much of a fighter. But she will fight with her friends <em>emotionally</em> just to bring them back to humanity.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>She can manipulate the earth and also foliage and plants. She can attack with them too, and also defend against attacks. This was how Little Bunny Aru was formed.</li>
              <li>Plantation Magic (Subsidiary Power) - She can magically manifest vegetables and fruits (only comes out as seeds or sprouts), but after that? It requires actual farming skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">Haruhi has yet to uncover the ceiling of her yokai abilities and powers. That could be do for another story one day!</p>

            <p className="font-mono text-xs text-[#a8ff8a] mb-2">👤 Age Biology</p>
            <p>Haruhi, despite looking like an adult of 26 years, will remain at that appearance even as she ages. Yokai Blood are different from humans. In a general sense, Yokais age like human babies until age 17. But it stops after the age of 18 (which is adult age), which slows down significantly. This process also applies to Hanako Reina.</p>

            <p>Haruhi being a Bamboo Bunny means that every <strong>2-3 years</strong> during the fall, she becomes in heat. This makes her lay eggs which is why she has a lot of rabbits and bunnies as pets when she was back at her farm.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Her heat cycles started at <strong>age 15</strong> after puberty, and last the entire fall season (ends before winter).</li>
              <li>During each cycle, she lays approximately <strong>10 eggs total</strong>, but only <strong>3-4 of them successfully hatch</strong> into non-magical, non-yokai bunnies. The remaining 6-7 eggs are empty.</li>
              <li>She has experienced <strong>5 heat cycles total</strong> throughout her life (ages 15, 17, 20, 23, and 26), producing the <strong>17 bunnies</strong> she currently has at her café.</li>
