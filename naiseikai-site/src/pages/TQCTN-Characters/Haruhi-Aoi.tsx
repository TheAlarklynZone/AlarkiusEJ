          <p>Haruhi Aoi is the owner of Usagi Cafe, a cafe full of bunnies that she takes care of. She comes from the plains and farmlands, having owned a farm once — but it was tragically destroyed in a hurricane when she was in middle school (after graduation). Somehow, most of her animals survived, including her rabbits and bunnies. She later moved to Tokyo to look for work and attend high school.</p>
          <p>That was where she met her best friend, Koa Ruruka.</p>
          <p>Haruhi is a Shifter — a Bamboo Bunny. Her ears are able to pick up:</p>

        <h3 className="font-serif text-lg text-text mb-4">The Four Identities</h3>
        <IdentityBlock icon="😃" title="The Social Self">
          <p>Extremely social and extroverted with everyone she knows. She's the one who starts up conversations about board games even when friends are over, not just Ruruka or Hanako. Warm and bubbly. Sometimes an airhead, sometimes serious. The soft comedic relief. Easy to get along with and cutely lovable.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🦋" title="The Personal Self">
          <p>With her closest friends Reina and Ruruka, she allows herself to be fully open because she trusts them. She was friends with Ruruka first — after they broke up due to different tastes, Ruruka gave her space to be herself, which brought out her extroverted personality. When she met Reina for the first time working together, she became a teacher — taught her how to cook. And when alone with her thoughts... she's just Haruhi.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="Core Self — 1">
          <p>Often reserved when alone. Sometimes the thought "am I enough for others?" surfaces — but she doesn't take it too personally. She's an Empath, a quirk of being a Bamboo Bunny Yokai. She knows right from wrong, which helps her distinguish what is true. Sometimes, Little Bunny Aru invades her thoughts with anime J-pops to cheer her up.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="Core Self with Little Bunny Aru — 2">
          <p>Little Bunny Aru. Haruhi's core daughter who embodies carefreeness and child-like innocence. She gave birth to her (not literally) through her Earth and Plant Magic, which accidentally gave Little Aru a mind of her own — (YEAH THAT'S ME LITTLE ARU THE WALL BREAKER!!!). Aru, the gremlin and chaotic side of Haruhi, literally anchors her back when Haruhi starts thinking wrongful thoughts. Like a soft therapist but with unhinged energy. Their relationship is really wholesome. Literally a mirror of each other.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🤕" title="The Hidden Self">
          <p>Her abusive past with Asami is why she puts up her social self. She's secretly hurting because she always blames herself for what happened between them. When they dated, Haruhi would try to endure the pain Asami inflicted — not because she wanted it, but because she couldn't understand why Asami was projecting it. She blamed herself for not seeing through Asami. And despite the pain, she doesn't even know why Asami did all those things before breaking up over text. Asami disappeared shortly after — which broke Haruhi's heart all over again. Despite everything, she dated Koa Ruruka for a while because she wanted someone to cling to. Ruruka gave great advice and just quietly showed up for her. Haruhi fell for Ruruka hard — but Ruruka's love was more protective than romantic. Which is why Haruhi's love couldn't reach further. She doesn't consider this heartbreak though. Just mutual understanding.</p>
