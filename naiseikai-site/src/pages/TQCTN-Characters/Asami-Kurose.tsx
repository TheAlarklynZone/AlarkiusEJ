          <p>She's a descendant of the Octoquid Yokai Line from 1779, which was where the YARC began their activities. They captured all Octoquid alike and infused them with a <em>cursed tome</em> of Venomous Snake Blood, causing them to become half octoquid and snake. They then released them into the wild to cause violence under control. Not every Octopi followed orders — some hid from the YARC. Some fled to Mizuki Shoto for freedom.</p>
          <p>Among those family lines within the OctoQui Lineage, one became <span className="font-mono">Kurohashi (1)</span>, then <span className="font-mono">Kurohase (2)</span>, <span className="font-mono">Kurokaze (3)</span>, <span className="font-mono">Kurohana (4)</span>, and finally — <span className="font-mono text-[#d49fff]">Kurose</span>. The last generation of the Kurohashi Family.</p>
          <p>To some people, she gave off a very chill aura of control and grace. But beneath all that surfaced laid a girl that was victimized by the YARC.</p>

        <div className="callout space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          <p>Asami Kurose is a deeply dangerous and psychologically complex octopus yokai. She was once Haruhi Aoi's former lover before she disappeared without notice. Hailing from Sapporo (Hokkaido), she was known in her earlier years as a High School student (first year) as cold, composed, and mysterious. She has an uncanny ability to remain calm even under verbal abuse.</p>
          <p>She is a repeat offender. Kurose was eventually captured by the YARC where she was registered as Subject 6. Her records include allegations of manipulation, predatory behavior toward younger yokai girls, and multiple unconfirmed assaults. While under YARC watch, she was brutally mistreated by other yokai, forced into servitude under the corrupted director Shikuibito (The Death Eater Spirit).</p>
          <p>She was once impregnated by a Demon Yokai, and birthed a child, which was labeled a "defect" — tragically killed inside the facility. She also birthed another child, an octopus crossed mermaid. Also killed. Her time in the YARC was short lived, often escaping and getting captured again. Each time she was captured, she was forced to confront her own fears with the Telepathy Regulators the YARC supplied.</p>

      {/* Relationship with Haruhi */}
      <div>
        <h3 className="font-serif text-lg text-text mb-4">Her Relationship with Haruhi Aoi</h3>
        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          <p>In her first year of high school (even with so much going on), Haruhi asked her out. At first, Asami wondered why she asked — but Haruhi confessed that she liked her cold and mysterious composure. They dated for a while. But it wasn't good. The influences from the YARC ingrained into Asami's mind caused her to torture Haruhi unknowingly: Emotional Grooming, physical assault, and coercive control.</p>
          <p>Haruhi endured it all. Not because she wanted it — but because she didn't understand why Asami was projecting it. She blamed herself for not seeing through Asami.</p>
          <p>For Asami, this was her way of release — despite all the harm she caused. The institutional system may have broken her, but all she wanted was intimacy. To her, it was softness over unrelenting love — a love that felt exploitative but burned with <em>passion</em> that neither hurts nor discriminates.</p>
          <p>Haruhi failed to see past all the masks Asami wore.</p>
          <p>One day, Haruhi sent a breakup text. Asami, seeing this, disappeared. Couldn't respond. Only until the YARC found her again and imprisoned her — before she broke out one last time.</p>
          <div className="border-l-2 border-[#d49fff] pl-3 italic text-text-faint">
            Kurose represents a darker consequence of broken institutions and unresolved cycles of abuse, trauma, and manipulation. But behind her violent history lies a question — was she always this way, or did the YARC mold her into the monster she became?

      {/* Four Identities */}
      <div>
        <h3 className="font-serif text-lg text-text mb-4">The Four Identities</h3>
        <IdentityBlock icon="😃" title="The Social Self">
          <p>Used to have an aloof personality since she was regarded as one of a kind — an octopus. Her aloofness was kind of like a cat's — very playful underneath. But ever since the YARC showed up, her personality started to change.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🦋" title="The Personal Self">
          <p>She calls herself a monster — she thinks she's not worthy of others, let alone close friends. She views herself as insignificant and less than human ever since she began escaping the YARC. Even when she dated Haruhi, things took a drastic turn. She'd often manipulate Haruhi with telepathy just to feel safe. The reason she dated Haruhi was because she wanted to feel love — Haruhi's softness felt like Asami's only light.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="Core Self">
          <p>Her core self is mixed with her personal self. Because her relationship with Haruhi isn't just wrong — <em>she knows it is.</em> Even with everything happening, she wants to reconcile with her but can't even bring it up because the YARC would come in at random times to take her back. Haruhi has no idea that Asami is being victimized by an institution that gave her all those bad habits and actions.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🤕" title="The Hidden Self">
          <p>Institutional and systematic abuse. The YARC broke her even when she was dating Haruhi. She has bruises, injuries, and scratches from every breakout — because Haruhi was the only light Asami could see.</p>
          <p>What Asami doesn't fully know herself is that she craves love with excessive softness. She wants to feel love, to be loved, to be respected. All she ever wanted was for someone to see her for who she is — but her judgement always gets the better of her, which is why she lashes out.</p>
          <p>After Haruhi's breakup text, Asami became afraid. Scared to even respond. She became depressed. The YARC finally took her and held her captive for years. When she broke out one last time, she wanted to die — but the one thing that kept her going was Haruhi. She wanted to see her one last time. Not for forgiveness. She knows what she did was wrong. But those hollow emotions she held back are what prevent her from repairing that relationship. Both their bonds are already broken — yet Haruhi doesn't even realize that Asami truly loved her. Still does.</p>
