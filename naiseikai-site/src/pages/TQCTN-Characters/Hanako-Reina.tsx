        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          <p>Hanako Reina, is an estranged girl who grew up in an abusive relationship with her parents. Her parents viewed her as inferior and she was later kicked from the family. Despite her shortcomings, Hanako is very optimistic, and knows what is right or wrong. However, even though people shun her for who she is, it puts a lot of anxiety and stress. She suffers from trauma and PTSD, and often has severe anxiety attacks out of nowhere, and people don't help her despite some that do. It still doesn't change the fact that her emotions are very fragile, easy to break.</p>
          <p>She was laid off her job, Customer Service from retail, and evicted from her apartment. The only place she could turn to is a free shelter, and works at a cat daycare as a temporary job. The people there are nice and mean no harm to her.</p>
          <p>One day, however, alone at a park, her cries to herself escaped from her voice (loud but quiet). She was saved by a lovely person by the name, Koa Ruruka, who saw nothing but pity and sadness for Hanako. She took her in to care for her. The first two days, Ruruka recommended Hanako to work a Bunny Cafe, since she noticed that Hanako loves bunnies (Haruhi's Usagi Cafe!).</p>
          <p>A few months living with Ruruka, Hanako confessed her feelings to Ruruka, unable to contain her emotions for her. She loves her in a romantic way, but Koa dodges that until her feelings for Hanako change.</p>

      <div>
        <h3 className="font-serif text-lg text-text mb-4">The Four Identities</h3>
        <IdentityBlock icon="😃" title="The Social Self">
          <p>Lighthearted and chill (literally). She opens to those who aren't intrusive or loud. But other than that? She's very laidback with the people she meets. In fact, she's friends with almost everyone in the Usagi Cafe she works at, not just Haruhi, but even regular customers! The people there love how far she has come as a person, from that soft timid girl to a girl with an open personality. She always holds back just in case something happens.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🦋" title="The Personal Self">
          <p>With her closest friends Haruhi and Ruruka (Ruruka being her girlfriend now), Reina becomes warm and bubbly around them. Best friends with Haruhi since she allowed Reina to grow naturally at her own pace. In fact, Haruhi doesn't know this but Reina deeply treasures her for who she is right now, not just her past. But with Ruruka…..<em>oh things are spicy.</em> Ruruka craves affection and touch now that she's trying to change for the better. She often asks Reina for kisses and hugs even if she doesn't. Reina is warm and bubbly around Ruruka because she loves her very much now. In fact, Ruruka doesn't know this but Reina loves her so much, that she would kill anyone who stands in their way (Not Haruhi). Reina is a gremlin whenever Little Aru is around.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🦋" title="The Personal Self with her Powers">
          <p>Reina's powers aren't all that dangerous. She has passive powers that she likes to use daily when the opportunity arises. She took Ruruka on a ride in her giant bird form once. Pranked Ruruka with her small bird form! Often likes to prank Haruhi with Telekinesis. She can also extend her powers to make both her friends feel equal to her if they request of it. Freezing Touch is one of her favorite abilities.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="The Core Self">
          <p>The silence that Reina treats to is how she heals herself. It's not just her powers telling her how to heal, it's how she survives, even at a young age. Often cold and quiet, sometimes shrinks when arguments arise, but she never takes it too personally. Despite being intersex with male and female systems, she tries not to degrade her own body or feel insecure about it. Because of Ruruka's words that she accepts her for who she is, Reina is trying her best to treasure her own body for who she is.</p>
          <p>Sometimes would get….<em>aroused</em> if Ruruka does something…….off putting or….<em>tempting</em>.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="👤" title="The Core Self with her Powers">
          <p>Reina holds back, obviously. But even with these absurd supernatural powers, she doesn't want to hurt Ruruka or Haruhi. Because she's trying to love them equally as they love her for who she is, even if its the front she puts on, or her own hidden self.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🤕" title="The Hidden Self">
          <p>Trauma is the root of her hidden self which is why she retreats to her core self. Ever since a child, she's been victimized by her parents and also from people who abuse her out of nothing. It's not just abuse, but also verbal through gossip and other means, which hurts her soul. Even her own parents (now dead) viewed her as inferior and a tool. Tried to strip her agency by trying to get surgery for both of her "uniqueness." She'd often end up getting sent to different wards from the YARC so that they could test her capabilities as a yokai, not as a human or a person. Each time she goes, her anxiety and emotions would explode, causing massive large scale destructions at the YARC's laboratories and buildings. She's destroyed over 2,300 ward buildings and killed lots of yokai representatives from the YARC.</p>
        </IdentityBlock>
        <IdentityBlock icon="🤕" title="The Hidden Self with her Powers">
          <p>Her relationships with her own powers are tied emotionally. A Pressure Cooker. If pushed too far, she would explode in a fit of either: Rage, Grief, Regrets, Burdens….etc. Her powers are extremely dangerous, aside from her passive ones. Think like Mob Psycho 100, but there's no cap or limiter to restrain these powers within Reina. She also develops new powers subconsciously because her powers are like background instruments. They change and add new stuff to her arsenal.</p>

            <p>Reina, despite looking like an adult of 24 years, will remain at that appearance even as she ages. Yokai Blood are different from humans. In a general sense, Yokais age like human babies until age 17. But it stops after the age of 18 (which is adult age), which slows down significantly. This process also applies to Haruhi Aoi.</p>
