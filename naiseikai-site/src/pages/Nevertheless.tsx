            At 24, Reiko Nanako is overwhelmed. Her parents abandoned her and her younger sister, Asahi, when they were just
            kids, leaving Reiko to shoulder the burden of everything. Now that Asahi is of coming age, Reiko still struggles to
            maintain herself. She's already an adult and she's juggling college, a waitress job, therapy, and a psychiatric ward.
            Now, she's at her breaking point — exhausted and desperate for a way out of this relentless cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reiko's only solace comes from her three friends: Koharu Inoue, fiery yet fiercely loyal; Cyllvia April, the
            international student from London; and Shion Nozomi, a quiet girl with a heart of gold — who has a secret just
            waiting to come to light. But even with her friends' support, they can't ease the growing distance between Reiko
            and Asahi.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Asahi nears her 20th birthday, the gap between the sisters widens, as if a massive bridge had formed. Despite
            living under the same roof, Asahi is desperate to close the emotional chasm her sister has built. She wants her
            sister to see that she doesn't need to be a martyr — she just wants the sisterly bond they once had.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will Reiko finally let go of the weight she's carried all these years, or will the distance between them grow too
            great to fix? Journey into the story, <em>"Nevertheless, You're Still My Sister!,"</em> to discover how she will
            overcome her struggles of trying to be invincible, all while fixing her relationship with her sister, Asahi!

          <p>
            Asahi Nanako is the younger sister of Reiko. At a young age, both their parents left them due to a severe flu season.
            The two were alone, with Reiko shouldering everything — bills, jobs, funding, and more. Because of this, Asahi noticed
            the huge gap in their sibling dynamic. Her sister stopped feeling like a sister; she became a parent. The sibling bond
            they once had disappeared overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, Asahi became cold and distant from Reiko — harsh, even. Reiko tries to reach her, but is met with scowls
            and resentment. A few weeks into July, Asahi turns 20 on the 17th, and that birthday becomes a turning point.

              Dark Chestnut, sometimes in a low messy ponytail or left to hang with subtle waves. Often has <strong>overgrown bangs</strong> that slightly
              cover one eye — an unspoken visual wall between her and the world. Strands that frame her face make her look perpetually tired or uninterested.

              (tsurime-meets-tareme hybrid), like she's always a bit annoyed or lowkey sad. Rarely makes direct eye contact unless she's

              Casual but aloof. Oversized off-shoulder knits or hoodies in dusty colors (mauve, grey, pale navy). Legs always warm: long socks,
              black tights, or soft sweats — but her upper half is often bare or slouchy. Symbolic, maybe? Guarded below, exposed above.
              Rarely dresses for style — more out of mood or emotional state. (Reiko used to dress her up cutely as a kid… not anymore.)

            Reiko Nanako is the older sister of Asahi. She's hardworking, studious, open, and kind. She goes to college and works

            <p className="mt-3">
              All the burden became too much. She hid the pills in her car along with a note before her friends found her, completely
              drowning in low self-esteem. What felt like a week in the psychiatric ward was actually a month. She had neglected
              everything — friends, sister, herself. She didn't care. She wanted it to end.

            On July 17th — Asahi's birthday — Reiko didn't want to go home. Too afraid to look at Asahi. She went to Koharu's
            apartment instead. But Asahi was there. Asahi, finally seeing her, broke down angrily: ranting about her sister's
            disappearances, shortcomings, and worst of all — the suicide note.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reiko explains. Her friends were furious — because they secretly knew Reiko couldn't be all things at once: a mom,
            a dad, a sister, all while balancing college, work, therapy, and a psychiatric ward. She had become a martyr.

              Long dark chestnut, tied in a low bun or ponytail — often messy from running around. A few strands fall loose,
              a visual metaphor for losing control no matter how hard she holds it together. Sometimes wears a clip Asahi gifted

              Layered and practical — a work uniform top with a jacket tossed over, or a simple turtleneck and slacks for school.
              Sometimes wears old aprons over cute skirts — mismatched between her student life and adulting chaos. Her therapist

              Hands always full, but never shaking — she has to hold it together. Straight-backed posture from years of pretending

            shifts drastically: strict, caring, controlling, and sometimes even hostile. When she's drunk on beer, it's the
            complete opposite — straightforward, flirty, open, and timid.

          <p>
            Shion Nozomi is Reiko's best friend from college. Quiet and not one to talk much — but very smart. She excels in her
            studies. She can act reserved, but becomes extroverted when given time to open up. Her unique personality is what drew
            Reiko to her: Reiko had a very patient nature, and Shion responded to that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shion comes from a wealthy line of martial arts masters, but she doesn't care much about wealth. She skipped
            several school levels due to her exceptional IQ of 185–200 (boosted by 3% owl yokai blood), placing her at the
            same college level as her friends — though she's smarter than all three combined. She holds back significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Asahi reached out, Shion was the first to respond. She went to Asahi's place, and their friendship blossomed
            into something more. Shion deeply cared for Asahi, and that's when Asahi confessed. They started dating in secret
            behind Reiko's back — both too scared to tell her.

          </div>
          <p>
            Cyllvia April hails from London, UK, as an international student studying Japanese in Japan. She comes from a wealthy
            family company called <strong>April Industries</strong>, which is women-owned and founded by her mother, Regina April.
            Both her mother and her siblings respect each other's differences and get along well. Her mother fully supports her
            daughter's future career as a Japanese/English Teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cyllvia is fascinated by Japanese culture and wanted to deepen her knowledge — she had two years of Japanese before
            furthering her studies. She is studiou, great at connecting with others, and infectiously open. She's a light brown
            brunette who loves wearing her London school uniform even in Japanese college.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's best friends with Reiko Nanako and knows her very well, along with Shion and Koharu. She also knows Asahi.

              Light brown with subtle brunette-gold undertones — smooth, shiny, immaculately brushed. Often styled in a half-up
              ponytail, or loosely braided with a pale scrunchie when studying. Side-swept bangs and faint curls at the tips —
              not too straight, not too wild.

              Soft teal or jade green — a color that glimmers in sunlight. Almond-shaped, bright with curiosity: the kind of
              eyes that widen when she hears Japanese spoken fluently. Wears round-rimmed glasses when reading or writing essays.

              London-style school uniform vibes even in Japan — classy blazer, pleated skirt, necktie or bow. In Japanese college:
              clean cardigans, flowy skirts, Mary Janes or Oxford shoes. Color palette is always refined — pastel beige, navy blue,
              dusty lavender, and cherry blossom pink accents.
