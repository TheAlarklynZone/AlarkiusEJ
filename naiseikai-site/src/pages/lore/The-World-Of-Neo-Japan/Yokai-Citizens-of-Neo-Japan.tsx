          <p>Swans are calm, dignified, and prefer peaceful resolution to conflict.

An enraged Swan Yokai is considered one of the most dangerous avian yokai in combat. The saying "Never anger a swan" is well-known throughout Neo-Japan.</p>
          <SubHeading>Reproduction:</SubHeading>
          <p>Swan Yokai mate for life and can only form romantic bonds once. If their partner dies, they enter a mourning period lasting decades and rarely bond again. Their loyalty is absolute—YARC attempted to exploit this through forced bonding experiments, resulting in severe psychological trauma for many Swan Yokai subjects.</p>

          <SubHeading>Social Challenges:</SubHeading>
          <p>Vulture Yokai face discrimination due to their association with death and decay. Many hide their yokai nature in public. However, those who understand their role deeply respect them. Ujuukyō faith recognizes Vulture Yokai as <strong className="text-text">Kiyome no Tori</strong> (Birds of Purification) and honors their service.</p>
          <SubHeading>YARC Targeting:</SubHeading>
          <p>YARC attempted to weaponize Vulture Yokai's disease immunity and decay abilities for bio-weapon development, resulting in many being captured and experimented on between 1779-1950 AD. Survivors carry deep trauma from these experiences.</p>

They value self-expression, creativity, and recognition. However, their pride can become their weakness—insults to their appearance or abilities cut deeply.</p>
          <SubHeading>Social Dynamics:</SubHeading>
          <p>Peacock Yokai often form tight-knit communities in urban centers like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto where they can showcase their talents. They maintain elaborate social hierarchies based on beauty, talent, and influence. Some view this as shallow, but Peacock communities provide strong support networks and mentorship for younger yokai.</p>
          <SubHeading>Combat Style:</SubHeading>
          <p>While Peacock Yokai prefer to avoid physical combat, they are devastating psychological combatants.

        <YokaiEntry name="Angels (Tenshi)" color="#ffffff">
          <p>Angels descended to Ancient Japan during the great arrival of Year 5 - 1599 alongside Yokai and Spirits. They are celestial beings with their own supernatural abilities and spiritual significance. Tenshi Shima (Angel Island) serves as a sacred territory connected to angelic beings, protected by spiritual barriers and restricted to most civilians. Angels can also become Ninjas, known as Tenshi-kō-shin (Angel Path Ninja) within the NYAQ. Tenshi Shima is one of the two locations where Yokai Relinquishment rituals can be performed.</p>

        <YokaiEntry name="Yokai: Phoenix (Fushichō)" color="#ffaad4">
          <p>Phoenix Yokai are among the rarest yokai in Neo-Japan, with fewer than 50 estimated to exist. Unlike other yokai who descended during Year 5 - 1599, Phoenix Yokai existed in the spiritual realm long before and only manifest during times of great upheaval or transformation. They are revered as <strong className="text-text">symbols of renewal, hope, and transformation</strong>, often serving as spiritual counselors, mediators, and ceremonial figures for major life transitions. Phoenix Yokai possess radiant plumage in fiery colors with eyes that glow like molten metal, and their touch radiates natural warmth.</p>
          <p>Phoenix Yokai undergo <strong className="text-text">cyclical renewal</strong> — when they reach the end of their life cycle (after several centuries) or suffer mortal injury, their physical form dissolves into flames and they are reborn from the ashes, sometimes retaining memories of their previous existence. They are patient, wise, and philosophical, viewing life through the lens of cycles. Due to their rarity, they are solitary and live in scattered enclaves throughout the Hanami Region shrines, Otohashi Yama temples, and Ryū no Shima sanctuaries.</p>
          <p>YARC targeted Phoenix Yokai for experimentation between 1779-1950 AD, attempting to weaponize their renewal abilities through forced rebirth experiments that caused severe identity fragmentation and trauma. Survivors remain deeply wary of governmental organizations, with many dedicating themselves to helping other trauma victims heal. In Ujuukyō faith, Phoenix Yokai are seen as living embodiments of Mushin (無心)—accepting life's flow without attachment.</p>
