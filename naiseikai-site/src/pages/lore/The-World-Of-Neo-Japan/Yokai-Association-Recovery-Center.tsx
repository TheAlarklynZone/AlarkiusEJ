      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Formed in 1779 AD by the YHCA (Yokai Human Coalition Act). The YARC rehabilitates repeat offenders into making them relive their past errors so that they can make up for it. Intense Telepathy Regulators were used to force criminals to rewatch their memories one by one, while breaking their minds. This in fact, corrupts them, and then breaks them. This organization's ethics are….mildly concerning.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The department disguises itself as a sanctuary of healing, but beneath its mystical halls lies a deeply flawed system of psychological experimentation and brutal telepathic enforcement (and entrapment).

      <SubHeading>空の深さ — Sora no Fuka-sa, aka "Skies' Depth."</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        It is located in <em>Sora no Fuka-sa Range</em> of the Sora no Oka's southern Region. The YARC resides on a very high hill in the southern part of Fuka-sa that oversees Okayama and Tottori in the Chugaku Region from the front. Behind this location, this building oversees the vast sceneries of the region.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        There are a lot of interconnecting hills around this area, which makes the terrain a little difficult to navigate. Despite the YARC being at a very high elevation, a road was paved so that transportation can run smoothly and easily. The hills and paths that lead up to this menacing place is less harsh than most other obstacles to drive on. Upon reaching, there will be a escalator-lift that will transport cars up and down.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        At night, the whole scene of this becomes very haunting and ominous. The white sleek metal reflects off the moonlight very well, even when it shines with white and black LEDs. With the moon looming over it, it makes it even more eerily still and quiet. Like an imposing building…<em>waiting—silently.</em>
      </p>

      <SubHeading>─────⊰ YARC Building Itself</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        It's shaped like the top half of a trident, just very wide, clunky, flat, and fat. The middle tine is where the main YARC building is, which is said to have up to 70 floors.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        The YARC Building is a very large building that looks very sleek and luxurious. It is built with metal that is painted white, and it has white and black LEDs on the top of it. It slants upwards and the top of it looks like crab pincers.
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-1 list-none ml-2 text-sm text-text-muted mb-4">
        <li>• There is a huge "Y" like shape on the front that is designed into the main building.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The two fat tines (also called Tine Pillars) on each side has Defcon Tine Towers (DTTs), next to the main building. These towers act like batteries that supply the inner workings of the UGF and below (and the main building). This section of the build is often referred as "The Triple Tines."
      </p>

      <SubHeading>The Underground Foundation</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        The YARC sits on a stone-like pyramidal pillar (circular) making it look like a mountain island as a foundation. Before the pyramidal foundation had stuff on it, it was a natural formation before the construction happened.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        This formation had a very flat top when it was discovered. And shortly after, The YARC was built on it. They call this formation, "The UGF."
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        The UGF has up to 100 floors downward, just below the main building. And within those floors, they are used for deep testing, facilities, and cells. These floors ranges from 100 - 1, descending in order. And Below Floor 1 is where the Failed Wing is.
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-1 list-none ml-2 text-sm text-text-muted mb-4">
        <li>• There aren't any windows on the exterior framework of the UGF. It is just parts that fit well with the sterile, mechanical feeling.</li>
        <li>• White LEDs are embedded horizontally into the UGF, which wraps around the entire circumference in evenly spaced bands, giving the interior a sterile, engineered glow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The surface exterior of the UGF, there is an escalator-like lift that can lift up cars to the main building. There are hidden parking lots that reside below the Defcon Tine Pillars.
      </p>

      <SubHeading>The Defcon Tine Towers</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Also known as "Defense Communication Tine Towers," (the long form name) these DTTs not only serve as batteries, but also for communications and defense, hence the name. They get their power from the sunlight and moonlight. UV and UV-ML (Ultraviolet Moonlight) gives the whole build a lot of power.
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-1 list-none ml-2 text-sm text-text-muted mb-4">
        <li>• A days worth of charge can last up to a month.</li>
        <li>• A weeks worth of charge can last up to three months.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When the batteries are off, the power still stays on. The energy is both self-sufficient and renewable. These towers look like huge batteries, with a satellite dish on top and a lot of other technical appliances. There are antennas on each of these towers.

      <SectionHeading>Purpose and Creation</SectionHeading>

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        The YARC claims to operate as a therapeutic institution. Its true goal, however, is to force yokai into reflection and compliance through artificial trauma cycles. Using specially designed "Telepathy Regulators," the department accesses a yokai's memories and projects them repeatedly into their consciousness. These sessions grow more intense over time.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Overexposure to their own failures, regrets, or violence is intended to create remorse. But in reality, it often leads to:
      </p>
      <ul className="space-y-1 list-none ml-2 text-sm text-text-muted mb-6">
        <li>• Catatonia</li>
        <li>• Emotional collapse</li>
        <li>• Sexual Assault on younger Yokai</li>
        <li>• Spirit degradation</li>
        <li>• Memory fragmentation</li>
        <li>• Identity erasure</li>
      </ul>

      <SubHeading>The YARC Staff</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Not all staff in the YARC are just Yokai Officials. Humans are often times roped into this like ex-officers, military, and navy who have been viewed as inferior or have been <em>discarded</em> (kicked out) from their positions. That's what makes it worse. Yokai and Human staff can't even bring themselves to kill each other, because of Death Eater's control.

      <p className="text-sm text-text-muted mb-2">
        Mutated beings from animals that can talk aren't entirely dangerous. Some are considered "neutral ambiguity" because these creatures live on lines. They can cross it or not if they want. Even monsters that come from this are used as guard dogs and wardens with a given task just to "protect" a certain subject. Some of these include:

        There is no line here and there are no sides. This is institutional horror at it's finest. The YARC has a lot of space in their buildings, specifically that backroom like storage that's hidden deep within the mountains. What goes on in here? Well…….

      <SubHeading>The Failed Wing</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Failed experiments are imprisoned here for eternity. Unstable and dangerous failed ones also go into this place. There are a lot of cells that hold these "creatures." There's no water, no food, and no source of light. Those who are extremely dangerous are considered a "threat" and are locked in quarantine deep within the mountains at a very low level.

        <p className="text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          This Cell is underground in the Failed Wing. It dampens and negates all supernatural powers. There is barely air here, little light, with no food or nourishment. This cell here contains nano-bots that self regulates the entire cell. Only drinks are offered, specifically electrolyte drinks. The minerals in these drinks contain a special uniqueness that causes "blood with little air" to flow faster than normal.

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Using allocated DNA, blood samples, cells, and sperm cells, the YARC has utilized this to a degree they can breed even without a carrier. There Yokai that are capable of being a carrier if this so called "cell" requires enormous power. Asami was one of them. The YARC doesn't sell these. Once they figure out more causes to the "yokai blood," they kill of the off-springs to dispose them like evidence.

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Tape-like parasites are used to feed and transmit stem cells to different experiments so that these "subjects" can eat blood from other yokai, demi-yokai humans, or failed experiments. It is said that even Yokai Blood (man-made infusions (and natural)) contain nutrients that help sustain Yokai Abilities when used, even if it's not regularly active.

        Yokai across Neo-Japan (and international) fear the YARC more than death. Children are warned about it in folktales. The phrase "You'll end up in YARC" has become a spiritual curse in some regions. Even the entire world knows of this shady organization.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
        Others, especially young yokai with unstable powers, see it as a place to avoid at all costs. The legacy of this institution is one of silence, whispers, and unresolved trauma.
