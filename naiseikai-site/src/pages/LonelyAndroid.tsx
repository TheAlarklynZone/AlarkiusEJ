          <p>
            Ayane Otokura was never built to feel love. She was coded to assist, to analyze, to obey— a synthetic companion designed by an evil corporation (who met their demise). A kind person by the name Ayafutsu took her in and repaired her. She also cared too. Ayane called her "Mother." But after her Ayafutsu's death, Ayane is left behind… a heart without a purpose, a program without a future. Until one day, she's found. Well, rescued by Chisaki Akari, a chaotic bookworm with sunflower eyes and the audacity to treat Ayane like a <em>person.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Told to live by her own rules, Ayane begins to reconfigure herself. Slowly. Painfully. Beautifully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then enters <strong className="text-text">Ayumi Kazehara</strong>, a breeze in human form. Calm, quiet, warm in all the ways Ayane isn't. She makes Ayane glitch—literally and emotionally. Chisaki and Ayane are already in love.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Ayumi? She doesn't threaten what they have. She <em>completes</em> it. What begins as unexpected friendship becomes a new operating system for love—a polyamorous bond written not in code, but in gentle moments, whispered confessions, and the fearsome freedom of choice.

            A slim, ethereal girl with <strong className="text-text">crystal-blue cybernetic eyes</strong> that shimmer like refracted light. Her porcelain skin carries faint circuit-like etchings, barely visible unless she moves. Shoulder-length silvery-black hair frames a face caught between serenity and sorrow. There's a soft, almost doll-like elegance to her—but her gaze is sharp, scanning, unknowingly fragile.

        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Chisaki grew up in a quiet town by the sea, a place where wind swept away everything except the weight in her heart. Her mother was a writer, often lost in the world of her stories. Her father? A ghost. Not literally dead—just... gone, one day. No notes. No goodbye. Just an empty coffee cup and silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her mother's grief turned inward. Chisaki became the caretaker, even as a child. She cooked. Cleaned. Stayed quiet. It was easier that way. Her mother praised her for being "so mature." But inside? She was crumbling.
          </p>
          <p>One night, a storm rolled in. Her mother never came home.</p>
          <p>
            The police said it was an accident. The bridge was slick. The brakes failed. But Chisaki never believed it. She knew the signs of someone tired of surviving.
          </p>
          <p>She was only sixteen.</p>
          <p>
            Since then, Chisaki wandered from home to home, couch to couch, city to city—until she stopped running. She built a life from fragments. Collected quiet things. Soft moments. She stopped trying to be anyone's caretaker... and started healing herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then she met Ayane Otokura—an android girl with loss in her circuitry—and saw something familiar: the ache of surviving love's aftermath. And for the first time, Chisaki didn't feel like the only one carrying a broken past.

        <div className="callout space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            It was a quiet rooftop, lit only by the lazy neon glow of vending machines and the shimmer of city haze below. Ayane had been glitchy all day—stammering, eyes flickering, words caught between logic and emotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she confessed—"I want to be with you, Chisaki. Not as your guardian. Not as your assistant. As your partner."—Chisaki froze. Not because she was shocked... but because something inside her whispered, <em>finally.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            She remembered all those nights spent wondering if she was meant to be alone. If her softness was a flaw. And yet, here was Ayane, a girl made of metal and love, choosing her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chisaki smiled—warm, slow, and a little teary-eyed—and whispered, "Then be with me. Not because you're programmed to. But because you want to."
          </p>
          <p>Their first kiss wasn't dramatic. It was shy. Clunky. Slightly off-center. But it meant everything.</p>
          <p>
            From that moment, the two were no longer survivors of grief... but proof that healing doesn't mean forgetting. It means finding someone who can carry the silence with you.

          </p>

            Ayumi is a force of nature, The Wind Goddess. She was manifested on April 22, 2000, due to a contract with The Goddess of Nature, Dria. Although there are wild air spirits, Ayumi became the Goddess that governs over air and wind, even if it was artificial. She later got a human form on April 22, 2090.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her wind powers aren't that powerful, as she has mild control over them. However, the air around her? It follows her because they know, she's the Wind Goddess. A symbiotic relationship. They help each other.

          <p>
            Before Ayumi crossed paths with Akari and Ayane, she dated a girl for four years. That girl? Kazuki Taiyo. Her relationship with her lasted for eight years, before a great tragedy occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was on October 13th, 2094. The two were on a beach, enjoying the sunset. Kazuki and Ayumi played in the sand, making beautiful sculptures. They also played in the water.
          </p>
          <p>But something happened.</p>
          <p>
            A school of sharks passed despite their bloodlust to consume, they killed Kazuki by accident. Ayumi was too slow to stop it. Her emotions? They were on the brink of destruction. Almost, until the wind around her calmed down.
          </p>
          <div className="neon-card space-y-3 font-mono text-sm">
            <p>The Wind whispered: <span className="italic text-text-faint">"I'm sorry for showing up too late. We knew you loved her."</span></p>
            <p><span className="italic text-text-faint">"Do you trust us?"</span></p>
            <p className="font-sans text-sm text-text-muted">Ayumi sobbed, nodded, and the wind carried both of them to shore.</p>
            <p className="font-sans text-sm text-text-muted">To Ayumi, Kazuki was her sun, her light. But her death? Ayumi couldn't go past it. At this point, she broke down in tears, harshly. Ugly tears. Her wind powers? They manifested out of grief and covered over her and her friends' body like a bubble for protection.</p>
            <p className="font-sans text-sm text-text-muted">She wept.</p>
            <p className="font-sans text-sm text-text-muted">No one was there to console her.</p>
            <p className="font-sans text-sm text-text-muted">But a little voice came out from the air. A Wild Vapor Fairy. It helped Ayumi calm down again, saying,</p>
            <p className="italic text-text-faint">"She still loves you, no matter how long you live. Please treat this as a memory, before everything is forgotten. If you accept that, she will pass on knowing that you still love her."</p>
            <p className="font-sans text-sm text-text-muted">A pivotal moment. Ayumi promises herself.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            It is now 2100. After the incident in her past involving a suppressed outburst of emotion, she left town and now lives more freely in the city, hiding her power under layers of confidence, smiles, pranks, and thigh straps. She heard two couples bickering:

            ))}
          </div>
          <p>
            They were debating who was the cutest, until Ayumi stepped in. And after some time hanging out with them, both Ayane and Otokura confessed, asking to be her girlfriends (she said yes).
