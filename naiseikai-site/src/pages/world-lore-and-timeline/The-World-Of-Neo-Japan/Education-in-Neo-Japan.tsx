      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        On March 25th, 1675, Education in Neo Japan has formed to help understand how the entirety of the world works. Education in Neo-Japan goes up from 6 &gt; 3 &gt; 3 &gt; 5, with Y5 for Yokai University!

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In Neo-Japan 2100+, education follows a unified progression that prepares both yokai and human students for their roles in society. The system emphasizes coexistence, spiritual practice through Ujuukyō, and understanding of yokai magic alongside traditional academics.

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        All students—regardless of species or class (wealth)—complete the foundational <strong style={{ color: ACCENT }}>6&gt;3&gt;3 structure</strong> (Elementary, Junior High, and High School) before choosing their specialized university path. Education is really flexible here in Neo-Japan, albeit with drawbacks. But the most important thing is that Education is about Faith, based on Ujuukyo Teachings.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Most of the professors, counselors, councilors, and teachers in this edu-system are Ninjas, since they hold a deep understanding of both human and yokai traits. It's very rare to see actual yokai or human teachers, but they're often here as Alumni or Shadows in search of a Teaching Assistant Field or if they want to be staff that works behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        TLDR: The NYAQ teaches Ninjas to always remain neutral and friendly, while retaining a curious and learning side, which is also a teaching from{' '}
