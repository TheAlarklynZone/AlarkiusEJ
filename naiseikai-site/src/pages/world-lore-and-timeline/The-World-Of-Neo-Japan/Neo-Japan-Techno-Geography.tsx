        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
          <p>Neo-Japan is significantly larger than the Japan of our Earth due to spiritual and supernatural influences. Earth Yokais, through their connection to the land, have caused tectonic shifts and the formation of new landmasses over centuries. The continent now spans a greater area with additional islands, mountain ranges, and coastal regions that did not exist in our timeline.</p>
          <p>While many familiar prefectures and cities still exist, their locations have been adjusted to accommodate the expanded geography. Some regions have been relocated entirely, and new spiritual zones have emerged that operate outside traditional prefecture boundaries.</p>
          <p>Earth and Water Yokai work together to build and maintain this technology for the benefit of all citizens. Their magic is woven into every component of the floating system, making it a true fusion of supernatural power and advanced engineering.</p>

          <ul className="space-y-1 text-sm text-text-muted list-none ml-2">
            <li>• Which is Year 5 - 1599, even when new supernatural beings came down.</li>

          <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">
            <p>Due to a lot of inhabitants of Earth and Water yokai, they have agreed to help all citizens alike by using their magic to turn the entirety of Japan's landmass TO FLOAT steadily on the water! So that means there are no longer earthquakes (albeit minor ones (underwater volcanoes)) and tsunamis! The entirety Neo-Japan <em>technically floats</em> because under its giant mass, there are strong earth-like pillars that lift it above waters.</p>
            <p>The stabilization is very smooth and it will not affect citizen life. All ocean internet cables run under this floating landmass. A very high neural network! If a tsunami hits the cliff-side walls of mass, the energy from that will be converted into clean renewable energy, which can power the whole of Neo-Japan for centuries if not more!</p>

              <p className="text-sm text-text-muted italic">There are rumors of an underwater yokai city somewhere under the floating landmass of Neo-Japan, but no one knows where it is. Mizuki Shoto's Founder keeps it a secret.</p>

          <p className="text-sm text-text-muted leading-relaxed">They are still there! Because of the landmass that is raised significantly, the beaches are at a lower elevation due to the help of all the Earth Yokais magic. There's a huge elevator-like slide that goes up and down along the walls of the cliffsides! This allows you to go down and enjoy the beach life. Shops are indented into the walls of the landmass which are tsunami-proof if it ever happens.</p>

They are effective when it comes to figuring out toxins or very salty saline that have been mixed with the ocean water. It doesn't use chlorine as an artificial adhesive for tap water. Instead, Hydrogen-Mint (a new chemical substance) is used in tap water which gives it a cool healthy feel.</li>
