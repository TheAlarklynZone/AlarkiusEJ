      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Unlike the YARQ and the YHCA, this Association is an ambiguity organization. A morally grey place where Ninjas (humans) and Yokai Ninjas gather.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        NYAQ is a very well known association. Even it's own name reaches from all around the world.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        <strong style={{ color: GOLD }}>Formed in 1795 by the YHCA.</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        There are a lot of yokai and humans who band together to become Ninjas through wealth, fame, and mercenaries. Ninjas are considered mercenaries in this world, or high classed humans. Some show restraint, while some don't. There are some slight corruption in the NYAQ, but it doesn't overpower the whole Ninja Association. Ninja Yokais that aren't human often protect their friends. Ninjas are the neutral line between Yokai and Humans. A line of ambiguity.

      <SubHeading>The Design of the NYAQ</SubHeading>

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        It looks very sleek, modern, but also ancient. It's building is compromised of metal, but the metal is tailored to be compatible with wood materials and also great leather textiles. Think of the building like a very large Japanese Temple, which goes up to 10.5 Floors from the ground up, and 11 floors from the ground down.

        <li>

        <li>
          <strong style={{ color: GOLD }}>Underground (P.01 – Z.11):</strong> From below Ground A0, Floors P.01 through Z.11 contain very spacious volumes of space that allow Ninjas to practice underground maneuvering at different levels. Floor Z.11 (the deepest level) contains libraries for tomes, talismans, and ancient scrolls. It is free for Ninjas, but if outsiders (non-ninjas) want to use them, they have to buy them for protection from external forces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong style={{ color: ACCENT }}>Above Ground (A.01 – J.10):</strong> From Ground A0 upward, Floor A.01 contains stores and antiquities. Floors B.02 through E.05 house aerial training facilities, research labs, investigation rooms, and mission briefing halls. Floors F.06 through I.09 are dedicated to advanced combat training, bounty coordination, meditation sanctuaries, and administrative offices.
          <span className="block mt-2">Floor J.10 is an open roof floor that allows space for big yokais to land on. It's not just for Helicopter landings! There is also a hospital suit on this floor. The means of this is to help heal and recover Yokais who have escaped from the YARC. The open roof floor here allows a great scenic view. Very beautiful at sunset. Helicopter Landing zones are ontop of the hospital.</span>

      </ul>

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Unlike the YARC, the NYAQ allows familiarity and a sense of belonging. It is also very big and wide, which is bigger than the Skypeak Obelisk from The Hibrythian Saga. (each of those 10 floors have a lot of volume!). The NYAQ is next to Japan Stadium.

      <SubHeading>It's about Training, Not Torture.</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Unlike the YARC's brutal telepathic experimentation and memory manipulation, the NYAQ focuses on <strong style={{ color: ACCENT }}>rigorous physical and mental training</strong>. Ninjas and Yokai Ninjas who join undergo intense discipline to hone their abilities through choice, not force. It also helps hone their spiritual awareness about other Yokai Beings and Spirits that come and go. The NYAQ builds strength. The YARC breaks spirits.

          <li>• <strong style={{ color: '#ff6b6b' }}>The Most Important Trait for Ninjas</strong> is that they will <em>honor</em> Death when their time comes. Because their mind is trained <em>rightfully to discern</em> whether their time is up or not.

      {/* ── Ninja Terms ── */}
      <SubHeading>The term, "Ninja" is a loose term, but sets the tone for all.</SubHeading>
      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In the NYAQ, There are Angel Ninjas, Yokai Ninjas, Spirit Ninjas, and Human Ninjas. In order to help differentiate who is on each side, the organization came up with four new terms:
      </p>

        ))}
      </div>

      <p className="text-base text-text-muted leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Dullahans, Warriors and Martial Artists also come and go to the NYAQ. They might not be ninjas, but they believe that <em style={{ color: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.5)' }}>honoring death</em> is also a <em>valuable trait</em> for spiritual awareness for all ninjas and warriors alike. Which is why they get along well with all Ninjas alike.

            Koa Ruruka was kicked out from her clan, The Koa Clan, but she went to the NYAQ to train herself physically and emotionally. All she requested to the NYAQ is for her to be less known, which is why fame isn't her number one priority, even though she knows she has that influence.
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-1 list-none ml-2 text-sm text-text-muted">
            <li>• Trained under the NYAQ at the Japan National Stadium, where her top recorded speed reached <strong style={{ color: ACCENT }}>90-120 miles per hour in under 15 minutes</strong>. She earned the nickname <strong style={{ color: ACCENT }}>"Speed Demon"</strong> through dedication and skill, not through having her mind broken. Ruruka gets along well with other Ninjas.</li>
            <li>• She can always go back to train and raise her rank if she wants.</li>
            <li>• Wanted Haruhi to become a Ninja, but she refused.</li>

            <li>• She's a Vampire Yokai! Her significance in the NYAQ made her stand out because of how quietly she takes out her clients and bounties without killing. This earned her the nickname, <em style={{ color: ACCENT }}>The Silent Striker</em></li>
