          <p>At the start of the creation of Planet Hetra, once water and life was filled, there was once a massive continent that almost took up the planet&apos;s body. It stuck out of the water itself. Zohl had named this continent, Greungeria, the grand continent of its era. There were many wildlife here including different kinds of beasts, direosaurus wolves, dinosaurs, dragons....etc. Before the humans came, there were Five Giants.</p>
          <p>These Giants once held massive knowledge of Queen Laeyana&apos;s Magic, as they were the forefathers that govern each type of magic:</p>

            where grass life was still active before a strange snow storm happened.</p>
          <p>It took nearly 200 years for the continents to settle into the current shape Modern Hetra stands on, but they didn&apos;t drift into place. The landmasses were violently displaced and and settled due to traces of hexicules within the lower mantles of crust, which caused it to become hyperactive (and cooling down significantly). But it wasn&apos;t as dangerous as it was compared to hexicule storms because The 5 Giants lived in this area and helped rebuild ancient civilization from the ground up even after the continental drift.</p>

        <div className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>In the Year of 15 AD, a huge war ensued over parts of the world. There were too many Sylphs which upset the balance of nhuemyn kind alike, and the Elves were the ones that started this genocide. Since Vivianya lived back in the past, her protection faded away for the Sylph Race after she had passed. A lot of conflict rose to war, which made the Elves more hasty and effective at their ways of hunting and killing. They&apos;re accusatory, volatile, and menaces. The Elves nearly killed 50% of the Sylph Population which was enough to cause fear into them. The remaining 50% went into hiding.</p>
          <p>Even during the active onslaught, two Sylph Representatives by the name Krentyl and Fahlia called up Queen Laeyana by accessing her Staff Altar out in the wilderness. They complained about the war and asked to be relocated somewhere safe, or, a new realm to reside in. Laeyana had huge pity for the Sylph Race. So she summoned Zohl, Aurora Rimaea, and Aloria to discuss what should happen, since Zohl was the one who made Planet Hetra along side with Aloria (with Rimaea being The Spirit of Life).</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote className="border-l-2 border-[#c9a84c] pl-5 py-1">
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c9a84c] italic">"I&apos;m not creating a new planet. I don&apos;t want to govern another responsibility while I have this one." — Zohl, politely refusing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Rimaea was officially retired from creating life (Unless asked). But Fahlia and Krentyl insisted. The Elves threatened their very existence.</p>
          <p>But Laeyana had an idea. Instead of asking Zohl and Rimaea, she handpicked out a Spirit from the Divine Realm to shoulder a new chapter. Her name was Nahfia, and her Role? She is the Spirit of Sylphs. The guardian and creator of all. Rimaea asked if Nafhia wanted the line and Creation Tether for the Sylph Race, and she obliged. She took it as her own and all ancestral DNA from the Sylph Line now resides in Nahfia.</p>

            now has creation powers. Since she isn&apos;t originally a Celestriax or a Lyeceriax, she has both of those Spirit Typing Powers. She wanted to do something nice for the Sylph Line, so instead of keeping them on Hetra, she created habitable formations in space. She calls this place The Sylphrelm, or The Cloud Abode.</p>
          <p>This place, however, is not round like Planet Hetra, nor does it spin on its axis, or revolve around a star. It is a flat, asteroid-like mass that has a top surface with a gravitational pull, similar to that of Hetra, which keeps the citizens and cities from floating into space. Even though the gravity keeps everything at bay, there is a huge round bubble like shield that envelops the entire mass, which helps give sunlight, air, and many other mystical properties.</p>
          <p>Thus, all the Sylphs from Hetra moved to the Sylphrelm.</p>
