            Within Ancient Hetra's Past, there long lived Dinosaurs. Big ferocious beast creatures that once roamed every corner on Hetra. The most activeness of Dinosaurs lived on Ancient Varleqe, Rynel, Norrane, and The Alarctic Alpines. However, within the great Jurassic Era, there was a global, massive ice-storm that forced most of the land dinosaurs underground. Some became buried within the lands, and some sea dinosaurs fled up north to the Alarctic Alpines. After the passing of the storm, no dinosaur ever set foot back on those lands. Instead, their move to the undergrounds made them adapt to the surroundings. Although, some of those dinosaurs still exist, since many have evolved over time to adapt to current modern civilization.

Though there are texts and myths that say these creatures may be real, it still remains a speculation to this day. Currently, there is no way to enter the said ruins, since the entrance is sealed off with a divine seal.

            This Museum isn't just about dinosaurs. They also have a section for modern animals too and an extended Zoo called H.E.LM.S Zoo (or HELMS-Z) where some fossils have the possibility to be revived but unable to be released to the wild. There's enough protection to keep the revived dinos (not the big ones) as the Museum's farm creatures or pets. HELMS-Z is not part of any political branch there for experiments are not done as much. Their belief in reviving fossils to their natural counterpart is to preserve their beauty. No mutation or vile experimentation.

              The experiments done are not dangerous. They are very safe and the doctors, along with scientists treat these creatures with care. Even fossils that are revived sometimes have a disability rate, which also prohibits the staff to release them to the wild. HELMS-Z is a sanctuary. Not a laboratory.
