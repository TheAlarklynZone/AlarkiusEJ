        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Raeya is a Highland Sylph and a friend (and also partner) to Kydel. Bred throughout her past races, Highland Sylphs are a very rare breed. The most common Sylph races are Southwing Sylphs and Sunpike Sylphs. Raeya is shy at first, but once you get to know her and open up to her, she&apos;ll be nothing but energetic, eager, curious, and fun to hang out with. Highland Sylphs are Magic Users and Healers. So if you ever do encounter one, you&apos;ll befriend one of them and they&apos;ll come on adventures with you.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Raeya was rescued by Kydel in the forest next to her hometown, Lenoria. She got caught up with a group of bullies but eventually, Kydel stepped in and ended it. Raeya, who was watching, felt safe, and also fell for Kydel for a bit after being saved and protected by him. She told him she was an inhabitant of Lenoria and they both headed towards the town. They later became friends.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          She&apos;s a strong and diligent Sylph. Sometimes, she can be a klutz and an airhead, but what makes her unique is her compassion for others. Not romantically, but for friendship and bonding. But this later changes in her travels with Kydel.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">Sylphs can live a very long life and they sometimes match a direwolves&apos; lifetime.</p>

            <h3 className="font-display text-sm text-[#f2ebeb] mb-3">Her Life on The Cloud Abode, aka, Sylphrelm</h3>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              She originally came from The Cloud Abode, known as The Sylphrelm. Growing up, her hidden secret lineage of being a Highland Sylph was talked amongst her peers and neighbors, and she hated how harshly they talked behind her back. She grew up under the care of a compassionate dryad, ever since her parents were killed by elves. The moral rule all the sylphs in that realm came to a conclusion: <em>do not interact with elves</em>. It will result in many different consequences, like death and other vile methods of punishment. It was also then where cross-breeding between different sylph races happened.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              When she found out her parents were killed, she went into a dark pit of self loathing, where her fears of Autophobia and Anthropophobia kicked in. She couldn&apos;t come out of her shell, even when people who knew her cared for her.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              After the Dryad noticed her wails of despair, she took her in. She was nurtured, educated, and properly felt love and kindness to the one who took care of her. This was something that Raeya wanted to cling to, even if it means finding a partner. Raeya believes that kindness and compassion should come first, rather than greed, control and of the sort.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              However, her empathetic kindness is a weak spot, where she can easily take advantage of. When she got older, her dryad-mother figure told her to go down to Midtheltra to explore the world, see what it has to offer. There, she came across a town named Lenoria, where the people there were extremely kind and nice, which had a very nostalgic atmosphere. It had reminded her the love the dryad gave her, and so, she roughly stayed there for four to five years.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              But after a while, when it became the year of 2245, a rather troublesome group caused troubles in the town where she was staying. She tried to defend her home and also the people who took care of her, but instead, her kindness was taken advantage of when a group of bullies beat her up. They ended up throwing her into a secluded portion of forest and continued to toss her around, noticing how frail and easy she was to manipulate. When all hopes were lost, a beacon of flame lit up and saved her from her predicament.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              It was Kydel who stepped up in line, recognizing the right and the wrong, along with the ways of a fool, and the heart of a poor. He had saved her from the troublesome group, and that was when he reached his hand out to help Raeya in her time of need. She saw this as another act of kindness and grace. Not even that but something even greater, a fruit and trait of bravery and compassion. This act alone from Kydel pulled her out from her rabbit hole, and she clung onto his kindness. That was also after he held his hand out for her, she developed feelings for him.

When Kydel first experienced a side-affect of Eruptio Fervor, Zohl had told her that he trusts her. And with her kindness leading her, she helped comfort her friend with kindness and gentleness, through her emotions and also her powers.</p>

Raeya never uses this magic since there are parts of it she cannot control. This makes Infernal Magic both dangerous and powerful.

However, there is only one subset of this power that affects the whole set: Blood Rage. Blood Rage is a magic power that consumes the users&apos; ambitions and lets them take control of whatever bloodlust emotion they use (much like Kydel&apos;s EF but more dangerous). This can appear as a side-effect and can randomly pop up at times. When in the state of Blood Rage, the user&apos;s vision gets obfuscated and becomes half-unconscious, disabling them to see. However, they can hear and move normally. This normally won&apos;t happen if this power is trained correctly.</p>
              <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">Then comes the nasty part. Every subpower of Infernal Magic gets used and consumed at a huge amount, simultaneously. After the huge consumption of energy and power for Infernal Magic, this will render the user immobile for an hour if trained correctly. If not, this will render the user immobile for a day. Raeya now has complete mastery and control over this magic as of <span className="text-[#c9a84c] italic">&ldquo;Hibryds I - A Grand Voyage, EP 13 - Mastery.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#7a746e] leading-relaxed">How they interact with each other, learn and grow</p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          When she first met Kydel when he rescued her from the unwanted group of bullies (in EP 4 of Book 1), she clung onto his kindness for a long time. But, she knew that relying just on this is not a good idea. Taking an emotion for granted that is both equally important to her and her friend, will not only result in a relationship that will cause pain, but also no room for growth. She knows that well enough.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          However, even though she <em>was </em>the damsel in distress back then, she was mentally unstable, whether or not she wanted to live or not. That was because she had this overwhelming guilt, not just being a Highland Sylph, but also not being able to stand up for herself. This is because she is very reserved around strangers, but open to those she knows or is acquainted with.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          When Kydel stepped in and offered his kindness when all hope was lost, she looked up and saw him as a <em>role model at first sight (and crush after)</em>. Kydel is a person who believes in bravery at it&apos;s finest. That&apos;s because if you face problems and fears without a brave mind head on, it means that you can&apos;t grow and improve from that experience. But after Kydel&apos;s influence on her, she no longer considers herself lost or a damsel, because she knew that this might become an obstacle between her relationship with Kydel.

              Later down the road in their adventures, Raeya had confessed her feelings to Kydel, making them friends to partners. After some fun adventures of battling, visiting sceneries, and more, the two decided to take a break in one of the worlds&apos; most famous attractions: The Skypeak Obelisk. It was right then when Raeya showed her true colors. With the pent up guilt she had over all these day of fun (where she kept to herself), she wept in front of her friend, exposing her emotions. Kydel saw her with her hair down and he thought it was beautiful.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              Raeya says that having long hair is what led to people talking back against her and not just being a Highland Sylph. It was a distraction&mdash;too sparkly and too long. It annoyed them, and even pained them to look at it. Even when she cut it to back length, they would still talk back against her (right now her hair is at a decent length).

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              After he reassured her, it was at this moment Raeya promised to herself to do better, be better, and be herself! From thereon, she aims to improves herself more, learning more about her limitations, and her strengths. And also, being able to bond with Kydel, who is someone she trusts and cares about.

            Both Raeya and Kydel knows it can be a lot of fun, but also dangerous. They vow to never hurt each other unless it comes to dire situations (or worse). Both of them can match each other in strength. But in terms of raw strength, Raeya comes out on top because her Infernal Magic is much stronger than Kydel&apos;s Eruptio Fervor. However, they never use their powers to take advantage of one another for unwanted gain or simply for mockery. Neither of them think they are more powerful than each other, but rather they acknowledge each other&apos;s strengths and weaknesses when it comes to power scaling.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            Naturally, they are proud to have their powers, and this also makes them, them. Their powers can sometimes be of help. They help balance and bring terms to each other. Both their powers, Kydel&apos;s Eruptio Fervor and Raeya&apos;s Infernal Magic rely on <span className="text-[#4ade80]">ambition, emotion, and control</span>. When one of them is not themselves, one or the other needs to remind them about the outcome of their powers&apos; actions. They need to learn how to depart from a future consequence that will not only ruin their bond, but their trust.

          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            Two sides of the same coin. Both need each other, not just their powers but their morality. This is to help balance their sense of humanity and their support for each other.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">Raeya has two weaknesses, one is easy to find, and one is a bit harder to exploit.</p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">One of her weaknesses are her wings. If her wings are either wet or iced she cannot fly. That is because her wings are made of a special material that can&apos;t be dealt with liquids in both their respective matter. If Raeya was submerged in water, she cannot fly, due to the fact that her wings are like rocks in water.</p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">Another weakness of Raeya is the center spot of her wings, from where they appear and function. That spot is called the Pressure Point. When Raeya gets poked in that position while her wings are out, it renders her immobile to fly for a few minutes. However, when her wings disappear when she&apos;s not flying, that option to poke her pressure point no longer validates the counter-effect of her weakness.</p>

This was the first time she experienced both until a kindred soul helped her out before she met Kydel.</p>

This power was &quot;gifted&quot; by Laeyana in return for something valuable. But since this type of power was latent within Raeya, parts of this power can be unstable, powerful, and dangerous. She fears that if she can&apos;t control it, she may end up hurting those who are close to her. This also changes her appearance slightly. Her clothing becomes reddish pink, her eyes turning red. She calls this form &ldquo;Infernal Raeya&rdquo; when she wants to go all out or as a last resort.</p>

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">Before it became a smartwatch, it was once a phone Raeya had but never used in a long time. But ever since she became friends with Kydel and Zohl, she sometimes uses it to take pictures. Later down the road, Zohl used his powers to turn it into a smartwatch for her so she could use it to to display her powers. She calls it the Rae-Band. She wears it over her cuff links but uses magic to hide it.</p>

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">She wears this on her left ear, but it&apos;s a single one. It was a present given by her dryad-mother figure when she was back in The Sylphrelm. It holds a significance to her as it symbolizes parental loyalty.</p>
