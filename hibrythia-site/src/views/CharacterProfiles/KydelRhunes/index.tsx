        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Before having a second sentience awakening by Zohl, Kydel was once a beast citizen of Varleqe, a super-continent home to beasts and mythological creatures. Kydel is a direwolf, a gentle but yet fearsome and powerful being. However, his former home and territory was ransacked by Werebels (killer rabbits), an opposing race that rivals the direwolf race. Through that unfair incident, he sought out a new place, Hetrania, a floating continent in the sky.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          One day, Kydel ventures around Hetrania and stumbles among a very mysterious cave. Not knowing what would happen, he enters and the cave shuts. He tried to get out but failed. Suddenly, Kydel got attacked by something of the unknown, being dragged across the floor before blacking out. Moments passed and he had woken up, only to be confronted by a spirit named Zohl. Zohl had told Kydel that he now has a new second life, being able to talk and be aware of his surroundings much better. However, he was still confused about this role.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Later that day, Kydel encountered an Owl named Leon, who clarified some of his questions. Leon, at old age, before passing away, gave Kydel his inheritance, thus along with a few new abilities. Kydel felt as if he was given a new life and a new chance, so he took this opportunity to venture around the globe, making friends along the way. Along his adventures, he encountered a Sylph named Raeya, who he saved from a group of bullies. Raeya and Kydel then became friends, whose bond will become unbreakable throughout their adventures.

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              Back when Kydel was a direwolf at a young age of a puppy, both of the three would travel around the continent of Varleqe. His mother would give him upmost care and shelter! Whenever they come across dangerous foes, much like killer-rabbits and other monsters, the father would fight. Sometimes, both the mother and father would switch out if one ever got major injuries.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              When he was scared, his mom would sing him a sweet tone to help comfort him from the scary noises. It helped him calm down so much, that he himself had memorized the tone. His parents are both powerful creatures, and with Kydel still developing his beast abilities at a young age, he was considered weak until the day he matured.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              However, this all came to a halt. In 0865 AD, a huge war between both direwolves and killer-rabbits broke out, which waged all across the continent. On the 10th day of Calderia (month 6), both the parents decided not to participate in the war anymore, trying not to risk their son to immense dangers. So, when they found a secluded forest, the three of them hid there.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              Danger awaits as their scent was picked up by their enemies again. The parents had no choice but to leave their son alone. The mother ripped a huge piece of earthly soil to cover over her son and scraped some manure over it (who was soundly asleep amidst the war). They left in secret, trying not to look back, to save their son from a gruesome outcome.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              As they ran, they lured their enemies to a huge gathering of both Wulfwing and Coppercrest Direwolves, resulting in a bloody battle, along with the help of demons. Eventually, the direwolves won the war, but the cost, of a lot of lives taken. However, the parents lived and decided to venture around a new region within the continent.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              After a few days from an intense war, both the parents approached a rather divine altar, thus where they met Queen Laeyana and Runerus, The Forefather of Direwolves. There she bestowed both the parents with human forms and magic powers, naming the father, Arzo, and the mother, Xyla. Both of them requested that Runerus should look after their son, and he was pleased to do so. Then, they were given the free choice to explore all around the world!
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-display text-sm text-[#f2ebeb] mb-2 mt-2">On his own&hellip;</h3>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              Kydel couldn&apos;t survive on his own, so after he was of mature age and his abilities still developing, a direwolf by the name Ruefeus (Runerus), took care of him until he grew up with complete abilities that allowed him to survive. Ruefeus also taught him other unique teachings, morals, ethics, and traits about Direwolves and other creatures. Later, when Ruefeus was satisfied with Kydel, he disappeared into the night.
            </p>
            <h3 className="font-display text-sm text-[#f2ebeb] mb-2 mt-2">The year of 2245 AD</h3>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              In the Fifth month of Escael on the 31st Day, Kydel became a young adult wolf. There, his home was being terrorized by Killer Rabbits, again, due to the land&apos;s history. He won the fight, but was left unaware that one was still alive. There, he sought new land to make home, a floating continent in the sky called Hetrania. As he made that place home, he took the time and got rest. The next day, on The Month of Calderia, Kydel found a very mysterious and mystical cave. He ventured in and found nothing out of the ordinary. But wanting to leave, the entrance to the place shut tightly, and trying to escape a few times became futile. Just then a very bright divine like light attacked Kydel, rendering him unconscious.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
              Moments later, he woke up to only notice that he gained a second sentience, an awakening from a Spirit named Zohl. Xyla&apos;s backbone teachings towards Kydel was the foundation of his faith, kindness, and gentleness for life and experiences. And from thereon, both Zohl and Kydel set on an adventure to explore how much the world has to offer.

          He was originally from the continent of Varleqe (as stated from above). Adventuring through the place with Raeya made it clear he liked being around people who are fun and optimistic. But with her, it is a different story. After he rescued her from her predicament, that was the point where they became friends. Aside from his aloof and social personality, he wants Raeya to grow as a person. And knowing that she has gone through a lot even though she hadn&apos;t told him, makes him care for her even more. This is because of his mother&apos;s influence, a gentle but yet, kind and caring soul. Kydel wants to live up to his parents&apos; expectations not just as a direwolf, but as a creature with morality.

Had he not helped her, she wouldn&apos;t be here today. And with Kydel&apos;s quick ability of discernment, he wanted to help her, no matter what she tells him.

              Their adventures together bring them joy and excitement, with a lot of fun! At a certain point in time, their friendship and relationship became pristine. One day, Kydel asked her about her background, and she was hesitant to answer. But, she eventually confided with a story about her past. In another turning event, Raeya had broke in front of him, as she wept uncontrollably. He did not laugh nor did he mock her. He comforted her with words of understanding and assurance as he hugged her with gentle care.

              This standing quote made Raeya realize her imperfections and she took it like a champion. Not only he re-assured her, he also praised her of who she was. She lacked little bravery to face her problems head on, but with him in her life, she feels like she can do it. She puts her trust in Kydel first, as she also cares about his growth! And from thereon, the two not only became partners, but best friends for life! :)

        <h2 className="font-display text-lg text-[#f2ebeb] mb-4">When it comes to having powers</h2>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Both Kydel and Raeya knows it can be extremely fun to have powers, but also, dangerous at the same time! Their oaths to each other are <span className="italic text-[#f2ebeb]">not to hurt one another unless it comes to dire situations</span> (or worse). Sometimes for fun, they like to tease each other of their strength in terms of power. However, they never, ever, raise their ego or pride about who is stronger. Instead, they praise each other for their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to power scaling. This allows them to learn from their mistakes and improve from it. However, Kydel doesn&apos;t know that Raeya is stronger than him because of one of her dangerous powers, Infernal Magic, which triumphs him by 30 fold times.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Naturally, they are proud to have their powers! Because that makes them, them! And they need each other in terms of balance. Kydel&apos;s power, Eruptio Fervor, along with Raeya&apos;s Infernal Magic, rely on: <span className="text-[#4ade80]">ambition, emotion, and control</span>. When one of them is not themselves, one or the other needs to remind them about the outcome of their powers&apos; actions. They need to learn how to depart from a future consequence that will not only ruin their bond, but their trust.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          They are literally two sides of the same coin. Both need each other for balance. Not just their powers, but their morality. This helps them balance their sense of humanity, and their support for each other!

As a direwolf within the Beast Kingdom, they have no sense of loss, only in pride, power, and victory. That&apos;s how they stay afloat within that hierarchal system. But when it comes close to the verge of losing a battle or facing defeat (facing humiliation), Kydel will try to find a way to not experience that. His pride as a direwolf is what makes him, him. But if you take that away, it&apos;s just a shell full of emotional deprecation.</p>

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">Kydel being a direwolf cannot consume or intake vanilla. All direwolves cannot intake Vanilla. This is because Vanilla is made up of a single enzyme, Ferulic Acid, which is made up of Nethaji J, Gallage, and Esben H. This single enzyme cannot be digested for it is a &ldquo;poison,&rdquo; a one-way death sentence. Even eating the plant that vanilla comes from will do the same type of damage to direwolf species.</p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">However, he can consume artificial vanilla because it is not extracted by plants but made artificially with sugar, beans, cocoa, glycol, or caramel.</p>

While Morphing, he may be vulnerable as he can&apos;t really do anything. Plus if the morphing gets interrupted it has a chance of distorting his physical appearance. However, this can&apos;t be undone by the user itself but with help from a friend that knows soothing powers.</p>

It will render the user stressed and tired for ten minutes, immobile for five minutes. Another drawback is that this locked power can randomly appear at times, which makes it very hard to control. Kydel experienced this first when he was traveling with Raeya, and she was there to help get this side-effect under control.</p>
