            The continent of Rynel, west Varleqe, Hetrania, and Lynneria, is smack-dab center of the globe (not literally). Rynel is another continent much like Norrane. Instead of operating on a large hexicule crystal, Rynel operates on the Oakgnar Grand Tree, which is considered to be the biggest and tallest tree in the whole world. There are a total of six locations on this continent, four being Oakgnar&apos;s towns, one ruin, and one city.

          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            The Oakgnar Grand Tree is composed of three main materials, a single Hexicule Core, Hardwood, and Stonewood. The Hexicule Core keeps the tree intact within the ground, serves as a light beacon, is nearly indestructible, and can regenerate its roots and wood when damaged. The Oakgnar Grand Tree is a symbolism where all the four corners of Hetra (earth) binds together where people are unified despite absolute differences of each other. A worldwide cultural festival will be held a month, yearly, celebrating life and enjoying it to the fullest. The time zone that the Oakgnar Grand Tree is located at is on UCC-0.

            South of both Oakgnar Towns and New Rynels. Rynel Ruins leads underground, with the ruins being the exact size of the continent itself. Scientists say that the Rynel Ruins leads to an underground ancient animal kingdom, The Feathered Dinosaurs. Though there are texts and myths that say these creatures may be real, it still remains a speculation to this day. Currently, there is no way to enter the said ruins, since the entrance is sealed off with a divine seal.
