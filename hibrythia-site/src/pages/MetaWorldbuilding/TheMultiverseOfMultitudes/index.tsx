          Hello!~ My name is <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Aeonia</span>, The Spirit of Time. Here, I will guide you through the vast concepts of The Multiverse within this series!
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The first mention of the Multiverse is also in our World introduction, along in the first book of the series in <span className="text-[#c9a84c] italic">EP 0 "Before Time"</span>, where it explains the introduction of the Multiverse. The Multiverse, better known as "many-verse"; many-worlds, etc — is a concept of Alternate Universes that share a universal ranking system. Whether be parallel realities, alternate realities, different worlds or mirrored worlds, these concepts come into one thing: proof of the multiverse.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          There are varieties of universes, as they are created through Ehckol Events. Ehckol Events are actions done by a chain of events that lead from one thing to another. An event with different possible outcomes gives rise to different universes, one for each outcome.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Some universes can take place in different periods and times, whether it be the ancient past, medieval times, a science-futuristic world, or a world set in apocalyptic times. This is because each universe has their own rules of how time passes in them.

          As for me, I am the one who helps create multiversal timelines and functions for each planet. I am also the one to develop the idea of The Outerbounds, which can be read below.

            In this continuity, there used to be a planet that had both prime-1 and 2 combined, which was called Prime-0. That planet was called "Gaia-666." History unfolds with the basic biblical events, along with hibryds, humans, demons, and spirits alike. Whatever happened in the Bible happened in that reality, but there was a twist. Many fallen angels began to breed with false gods and humans, which resulted with Hibryds, whom are known as Hibrythianoids. However, these two sides clashed with each other, with Christianity being the dominant one. Both of these sides see no solution for equality and peace, but only judgement, hatred, and power. Each of these sides fought each other through the ages, with no end in sight.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
            But in the year of 3356 AD, a super fluctuation occurred. The God of Gaia-666, YHWH ("yahweh," who was once benevolent in the prime days), had enough of the dire consequences of both parties&apos; actions. He placed a Distortion Apex Field and tore his very creation apart. This fluctuation caused the memories of the planet&apos;s to turn into Dead Shards, with their own timeline and universes. However, YHWH noticed that each of these shards&apos; memories contain dangerous effects and events. Some events can happen randomly, while others try to keep up to their own chronological order. But it is still not safe to travel to these memories.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
            So, with all his power, he sacrificed himself, creating an indestructible barrier called the <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Warping Hex</span>. No one can enter or exit without the use of Dark Magic and a Distortion Shield to negate the powerful changing effects of history in each shards&apos; memories. There are up to <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">9,999 shards</span> in total.

            With YHWH gone, the Dead Shard Continuity was left adrift, bound in the Warping Hex, lost in the vast non-Euclidean space. And thus was the birth of two new prime continuities:
