This realm governs all systems, including planets, stars, and realms. What makes this unique is that the \"Gods\" in this world are called Lhumerials. Lhumerials are omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Lhumerials are 10-Dimensional Creatures.",

The realm itself is a very large, planetary-like body, home to many mystical beings, aside from Sylphs and Air Spirits. To get to the Cloud Abode, you\'ll need help from a Mystic Dryad that can connect with beings that live in the Abode.

This realm connects to The Sylphrelm and The Stygirelm, two other realms that coincide with one another.

The Extreulux Realm binds the fabric of space and time together, as the two co-exist with one another. Raw Time Energy is an energy that helps regulate the great unknown (space) and it sometimes causes Time Vortexes — hurricanes of time that are unstable. These Time Vortexes act as a portal to Ellhumhellm for unknown reasons, and all of them take place in The Dark Zone, where the Stygian Realm lurks. This realm works together with The Divine Realm, since there are Spirits who use its power to create time-system structures for developing universes.",

In this place, there are no beings, no creatures, and no rulers. Aeonia, The Omnibound Spirit of Time, created this realm so that it can receive evil doers or those who commit grave atrocities or sins. Time distorts in this realm: it reverses, goes to negative time, and becomes hyperactive exponentially. When an individual comes here, their appearance becomes distorted and alternates from a baby to an elder, quickly. Everyone experiences this and when they scream in pain, the sound becomes nullified. They must endure the experience of their own guilt repeatedly. The realm itself has scattered lands of debris and craters caused by objects interacting with Time Vortexes.",

Though monks once attempted to reach it through Astralverging, the realm rejected them due to their prophetic nature, and imposed the curse of psychometry on those who got too close. To truly enter Illusia, one must become a \"Blank Slate\" — a soul of total emotional and spiritual emptiness — a state so impossible that only one being in all existence has achieved it: Hunter Noxx.",
