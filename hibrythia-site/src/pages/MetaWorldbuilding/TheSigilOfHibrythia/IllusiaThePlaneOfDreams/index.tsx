        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Early days and ancient years on Hetra, historians and astrologists of that time discovered that dreams are a dimensional plane. A plane that holds the possibility of different universes, parallel realities, and potentially, the existence of the Multiverse. Dreams in this world are one of the prime keys to unlocking the gates of the Multiverse, but the primitive technology at that time was inefficient. And even to this day, it is still impossible.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The astrologists of that time had their spiritual awareness, for most of them were monks. They used their affinity and power to try to lucid-dream and walk into the potential infinite possibilities of the Dream Dimension, but failed to do so because of a strange barrier. This realm is one of the keys to unlock The Multiverse.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          This particular subspace is a supernatural mental plane of existence that is powered through each individual&apos;s dreams. A subspace domain like this is called a <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Linked Realm</span> — like a fold or a sheathe — that is bound by everything, and is also present in The Outerbounds. Not only is it a manifestation powered by dreams, it can also be traversed in, through Astralverge.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Even if you can dreamwalk, you need a very clear mind, a relaxed soul that has no impurities or sins, along with emotions that might cloud judgement and assessment. You also need to be void of all emotional values, traits, and feelings — because the Dream Realm will only react to a state of nothing. A <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Blank Slate</span>. But it won&apos;t mind even if you show curiosity, since the realm is powered by dreams, but also by curiosity.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          ...but the human mind and soul is always busy, so even trying to clear your entire soul is impossible. Monks were able to do it, but the only consequence they have with Astralverging is <span className="italic">psychometry</span>. This is why Monks are no longer able to dreamwalk — because the realm banned it — because they are prophets.

              Also known as Astral Convergence, where it relies on the power of Astral Projection, Dream Inhibitor, and Dream Walking. This is an astral-activity of projecting the soul into a vision or dream. Visions and Dreams are an actual plane of existence, so in order to visit it, astralverging your soul into the Dreamverse is a near-impossible feat.

              A feature that is apparent inside the Dreamverse. Event Spaces are bubble realms that house different dream-like multiversal realities, each with their own memories and events of that significant time. It can either happen when a person goes into REM sleep, daydreaming, or if they have nightmares.
