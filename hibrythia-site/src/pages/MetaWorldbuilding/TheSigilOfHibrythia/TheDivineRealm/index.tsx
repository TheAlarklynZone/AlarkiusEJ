          The Divine Realm is above all realms, including the constructs the universe of what we know of: Time, Space, Matter, and Reality. This realm governs all systems, including planets, stars, and realms. What makes this most unique is that the "Gods" in this world are called Lhumerials. Lhumerials are omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Lhumerials are 10-Dimensional Creatures.

          In this world, the gods you will read in this series are known as Lhumeria. Lhumerials are 10-Dimensional beings. They're all-powerful, all-knowing, and everywhere at once (Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omniscient, and Omnibenevolent). But why are Lhumerials 10-D but not 17? This is because Lhumerials do not have the control over the last seven dimensions. They also cannot interact with The Outerbounds and do Continuity Traveling as their powers don't equal that of a spatial-realm's power.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The Dream Dimension is made up of Dream Essence, powered by the souls of humans and beings alike, melded by the power of the mind itself. Lhumerias cannot invade or interact with the Dream Dimension for if they do, they will lose their powers.
