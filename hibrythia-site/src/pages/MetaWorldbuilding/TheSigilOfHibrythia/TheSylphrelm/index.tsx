          It is not round like Planet Hetra, doesn&apos;t spin on its axis, and doesn&apos;t revolve around a star. It is a flat, asteroid-like mass that has a top surface with a gravitational pull similar to that of Hetra, which keeps the citizens and cities from floating into space. Even though the gravity keeps everything at bay, there is a huge round bubble-like shield that envelops the entire mass, which helps give sunlight, air, and many other mystical properties.

          This event is now immortalized as history. There is a memorial-like tablet on the Central Abode that details the full history of The Sylph Massacre from 15 AD, based on eyewitnesses, survivors, and victims. The saying goes: if you ever encounter an Elf or Elves, do not interact with them. That is the number one rule of the Sylphrelm.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Systematically and Astronomically, time on the Sylphrelm works in tandem with Hetra&apos;s Time System. The Sylphrelm operates on 32 hours a day, 444 days for one year, much like it is on Planet Hetra. This is all because of a special function: Hetra&apos;s second moon, Zenya.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-3">
          Zenya works with the main moon it orbits, Anzeya, which controls the tides. While that happens, Zenya, the satellite moon, controls the time, day, and length of the year — 32 hours a day, with great daylight, less night hours, but a longer year of 444 days!

            As mystical as it is, there are natural portals that exist on Sylphrelm, known as ley-lines, which serve as transportation to Midtheltra and The Stygirelm via the Rainbow Funnel. These flows of ley-lines are in direct contact and paths with The Extreulux Realm (The Space-Time Continuum), which are controlled and used only by a Mystic Dryad, who have the ability to use these funnels.

          They&apos;re High Air Fairies mixed with Dryads, Faes, and other wind-like spirits. Their ears are pointy and slanted backwards instead of pointing outwards like elves do, and their wings are semi-translucent. A lot of Sylphs have heterochromatic eyes that range from many different colors! However, there are rare cases where their eyes are the same color.

              All Sylphs have extraordinary speed and strength (it ranges), because that is where they prioritize their talents. When they fly, their flight speed is measured in BPS (Beats Per Seconds — Hummingbird Speed). Their speed can only go up to Mach 1-2 by limit, M5 if they undergo vigorous training. Their reflexes and reaction time are one of the fastest, outpacing a cat&apos;s and a fly&apos;s. They can also fly backwards and in diagonal directions when needed.

              The vocal range for Sylphs is all over the place. It can be low or high depending on the context. These vocal abilities make their music and songs elegant and atmospheric since they carry weight, longevity, and sweetness. This is used in Fairy Lullaby.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          The history behind the four Sylph races goes far back. The Southwing and Sunpike originate from the Cloud Abode, known as the Sylphrelm. However, two Sylphs from those factions decided to fly down onto the lands of Hetra and roam around, meeting different creatures, races, and humans. Along those travels, both the Sunpike and Southwing encountered land Sylphs, who call themselves Northtint and Greenpetal Sylphs. The Sunpike and Southwing introduced themselves to the Northtints and Greenpetals and they all got along naturally.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          When time passed, the Southwing and Sunpike agreed with the Northtints and Greenpetals to cross-breed races throughout time. When the rest of the Southwings and Sunpikes heard of this from above, they wanted to stop the cross-breeding, but failed. The leaders of both eventually agreed even though there were disagreements at the time.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Throughout time, the leaders of the first four Sylph races arranged and founded the Sylph Council, which can be found on the Cloud Abode.

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          A Sylph can live up to 600 years of age because time for them is slower. A fetus to a baby occurs very fast — this is because their cells materialize at a fast rate. This stops once the baby fully develops after three months.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-3">
          After three months, <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Sylphanization I</span> occurs, where layers of undeveloped wings wrap around the baby and turn into a cocoon. Sylphanization I occurs for 10 years. The wings that Sylphs have are made of <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Sylphium-Fiber</span>, a special genetic material in all Sylphs&apos; wings. They feel like cardstock paper, light, and have a texture of leather. However, the downside to Sylphium-Fiber is that it is weak against water. Once the wings are drenched, they don&apos;t have the function to fly unless dry.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-3">
          After Sylphanization I, the baby Sylph emerges as a child, who are called <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Sylphrey/Sylphries</span> — around the ages of 10-15, turning their lives toward education.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mt-3">
          During the 16th stage, Sylphries go under one year of <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Sylphanization II</span>. This is an optional process that Sylphries get to choose: to be born with magic or not. After Sylphanization II, Sylphries become adults, starting at the age of 17+.

        <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#7a746e] leading-relaxed mt-3">

          At first glance, a Sylph&apos;s ear can look elf-like — but the structure is different. Instead of one clean taper, it forms two distinct hook-ended extensions called the <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Upper Lick</span> and <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Lower Lick</span>, both slanting downward near their tips. The ear still has a Main Ear Canal like a human&apos;s, but the overall shape is elongated upward and sits at a slightly angled tilt. All Sylphs can control their own hearing sense.
