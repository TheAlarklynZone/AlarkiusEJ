              Every solar system has a sun that burns immense heat. And as we know in general, the sun is a star. This said star is in the center of the Nhumela Cluster, where 6 Planets orbit around! The Sun is roughly 178,270 Heunix (miles) in size. The sun's gravitational waves launches themselves at both horizontal, diagonal, vertical heunixs, allowing planets to orbit around the sun at different angles, or at different orbital rings. This sun isn't your average typical yellow sun. The sun is actually a Passion Star.

              <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
                A Passion Star is a very rare type of star, where it emits so brightly, it is easy to look at from space, and even from the surface of Planet Hetra (where the series takes place). This star, first spotted by Zohl (who is a Spirit of Creation), found it very beautiful. It's not too harsh, not too cool, as it maintains a very moderate heat signature.
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mt-3">
                It sometimes have solar flares once in a while, but they usually die down within 3 minutes or less. These solar flares, when scattered on Planet Hetra, gives the nightly skies a very passionate aurora borealis of colors! Passion Stars can live for a very long time, and it won't burn out within 51 million years.

                A process that enacts fusion between elemental particles and a Lyecerianite Core. This is where the energy within keeps at a lyceonic rate. The energy flows like a torrent of water and magma, as it runs at a <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">laminar</strong> rate.

                The Aqualivia Sun's color is very unique! It glows a very iridescent like color of sky blue, teal, with a tint of pink, orange, and red. It's very pretty. This type of sun brings better light source and moderate heat, with less radiation. This allows light on Planet Hetra to be a bit brighter than usual. But why does it look like this?
              </p>
              <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mt-3">
                This is all because of one single thing: A Lyecerianite Core (which can be read below), which is a type of crystal geode. The lyceranite glows a very beautiful color of sky-blue and magenta, with a rock like shell protecting it.

                After the discovery of the color, the people of Hetra have named this particular sun, <span className="text-[#c9a84c]">Aqualivia</span>.
