          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#7a746e] italic mb-3">Aside from Kydel being non-human and is a Wulfwing Direwolf Species, here are official designs for the original species, Wulfwings and Coppercrest.</p>
          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mb-4">
            Hetranian Direwolves are beast creatures, better known as "beasts." They are regional direwolves (some native to the continent of Varleqe) and they come in two separate species. All direwolves cannot intake Vanilla. This is because Vanilla is made up of a single enzyme, Ferulic Acid, which is made up of, Nethaji J, Gallage, and Esben H. This single enzyme cannot be digested for it is a "poison," a one-way death sentence. Even eating the plant that vanilla comes from will do the same type of damage to direwolf species. Not all direwolves have horns on their head.
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] flex gap-2"><span className="text-[#4a4844]">—</span><span>Manmade Vanilla or Artificial Vanilla (90%) can be digestible, but only in small amounts.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mb-4">
            There's a type of sweet that makes Direwolves become drunk or either high. Fermented Liquor Chocolate, is one of those substance. Intaking a substance like this will cause direwolves to become excited and playful, and sometimes, aroused. However, these effects will wear off in at least two hours. Fermented Liquor Chocolate is packaged in golden strips with a red-wine color label. All Direwolves can also eat chocolate of any kind, not just Fermented ones (and dogs in general).

          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
            Hetranian Direwolves have insane speed, strength, dexterity, and intelligence. They know how to discern.

            In ALL Wulfwing Species, they're around the size of a Mini SUV. They have a stout and tank build, agile and lean. Their white highlights near neck to head level along with their tail, are a default trait across all Wulfwings. Wulfwings are gentle and powerful. Their jaw force is super strong and can lift up to 20 units of force. Wulfwings are slightly larger than Coppercrests.

            Wulfwings have a few select abilities they use, some are passive, some defensive. Their speed is almost like that of a peregrine falcon's descent, but 4x faster. Their strength is almost like that of a hydraulic press at max. To compare, their strength is a lot more stronger than an African Bush Elephant, and their jaw strength, much stronger than a saltwater crocodile.

              ['Gale Step','Since their speed is 4x a peregrine falcon\'s dive, they can use sudden burst movement to evade rather than block — basically making them nearly untouchable in a fight defensively. Think "you can\'t hit what you can\'t catch."'],
              ['Concussive Howl','A deep, resonating howl that sends out a shockwave strong enough to stagger or disorient attackers. Not harmful — just buys distance. Fits the "gentle but powerful" energy perfectly.'],

            Male Direwolves will have horns on their heads and their ears are pointy. Female Direwolves don't, but their ears tips curve slightly inward like a tail lick. (Same concept for Coppercrests)

            Coppercrests are powerhouses because of their skin. Their fur and skin are made up of copper-nitrite, while their fur are made out of copper-keratin nitrite. It's silky-like and it's a green-brown-yellow gradient.

          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mb-4">
            Unlike Wulfwings that have a lot of variations, all Coppercrests stick to this unique design. Their bodies can withstand atomic attacks, bullets, nuclear, and a lot more, thanks to their copper-like skin that feels indestructible. Highly intelligent species. Prioritizes Defense over Speed, and Attack over Specials.

            The Copper Material in this world is not brittle or weak unlike Earth. It is durable and dense. Before Coppercrests even became Coppercrests—there used to be one Coppercrest that never had these copper-like genetics. It was supposed to be a Wulfwing with a Copper like crest on its chest. However, due to the strong stomach acids in direwolves that can break down anything (except Vanilla), the Copper Crested Wolf took a liking to eating raw unrefined copper, which resulted it's skin and fur to turn into copper-nitrate. Thus began cross-breeding with other Copper Crested Wolves, which eventually turned the entire lineage into Coppercrests.

          <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mb-6">
            Coppercrests are smaller in size than Wulfwings. Despite being wild beasts, they are super docile and tame around humans unlike Wulfwings. The scientists of The Eulerich Kingdom use Coppercrests to help aid in Defending against minority monsters, Armies, Peacekeepers, and Military.
