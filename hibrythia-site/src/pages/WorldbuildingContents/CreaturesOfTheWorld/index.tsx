Their fur color can range from gray, white, black, and blue, and they have diamond-shape patterns as their eyebrows. These patterns can also appear on their tails. Wulfwings are gentle and powerful.

Legend has it that the first werecat got its vampire-like features from its master in the ancient past, who was trying to combine his own genetic code with a Catrelwulf. To much avail, the master successfully turned one of the Catrelwulfs into a Werecat. However, the werecat became hostile to its master and left.

              Flimpies are airborne ghost rabbits (or bunnies) that are common everywhere. They are the ghosts of cursed rabbits that were a result of a genetic mutation back in the old days on Norrane. However, those cursed rabbits were on a ticking time-bomb. Flimpies are native to Norrane. Despite being ghosts, they can be visible during the daytime. Their appearance is quite loving and they mean no harm. Their colors vary throughout the world. Flimpies are currently not tamable due to how wild and elusive they are.

              The outer glow to the Flimpies allows them to manipulate it, like tendrils that reach out and latch onto objects. This is a small unique ability they use. They can also freely manipulate the charge of the glow to a static like feeling. However, it doesn't affect living beings. Aesthetic purposes.

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mb-3">
              A newly discovered species of Octopus-Owls. They have the appearance of an owl and their wings as octopus tendrils (four on each side). These wings both serve as extra limbs and flight, for they are covered in oil-based feathers that work well underwater, on land, and in the air. When on land, those limbs are served as legs and arms for land travelling.

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
              In the air, they are suctioned together to give flight. Although these creatures are nocturnal sea-dwellers, they are also active in the day. In the day, they hunt on lands for big prey, using their tendrils to bind and choke them to death.

              Pangolarin Bears are a cross-species, genetic mutated animal from Pangolins and Polar Bear breeding. Pangolins no longer exist, for their genetic code has been bred into Polar Bears at an excessive rate. These Pangolarin Bears can survive blizzards and even hailstorms in the Alarctic Alpines. Their fur is completely made of reinforced keratin, which is one of the hardest material in the world (this is what human fingernails are made out of).

              Hetranian Pyroleos are Fire Lions that are only exclusive to Varleqe. They are insanely dangerous and are impossible to touch. This is because their fur is heat-based sensitive to their surroundings and that they are constantly active. Pyroleos make it easy to survive in the Winter. Some places in Varleqe can reach below -0 degrees (C/F) and this doesn't even affect Pyroleos because their manes are basically a humongous fireplace.

              Hetranian Cranklaenkeys are crane-like monkeys. They are bipedal creatures, with arms as wings and their feathers as their fingers, with a fully functional tail of a monkey. Cranklaenkeys are avian and land animals, and they sometimes hang out in forests on the continent of Norrane. However, they are super loud and annoying. These annoying creatures also go by a different title, as "Rosemaries."
