                Some say that 1 in a billion humans have a Zytkx Gene or Chromosome that turns a regular human into a Humanoid. They've called this type of race Zytkx. Zytkxs are vessel-humanoids where they can adapt to their surroundings very well with the use of their enhanced senses. In a dormant part of a human brain, once the Zytkx gene has activated, all their current senses gets heightened to 10 times. And during that same process, a second heart-like organ gets formed in their body, which allows Zytkxs to collect powers from sources around the world.
