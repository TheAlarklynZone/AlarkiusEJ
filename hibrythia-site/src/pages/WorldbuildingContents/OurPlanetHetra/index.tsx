              Planet Hetra is the third planet from the sun in the Nhumela Cluster. This planet is in the Goldilocks Zone, which makes it easy to bear life and that life can live on here.

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
              This planet is a creation of Zohl, which was tasked by King Nhavah of the Divine Realm. Zohl created the galaxy first, which was named <span className="text-[#c9a84c] italic">"Anadeya's Eye,"</span> in which multiple solar systems will be in. One of the many specific systems Zohl was tasked to manage was the Nhumela Cluster (which is the name of the solar system Planet Hetra is in).

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
              However, before humans could be brought to Hetra, a foreign entity by the name Eienel threatened to destroy it. Zohl tried to fend off Eienel, but was too weak. Summoning the Earlywulf, a being from the Divine Realm, they both defeated Eienel and imprisoned the entity in an object called the Black Stone.
            </p>
            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
              After the commotion, Zohl and the Earlywulf decided it was best to exile the Black Stone away into the Skull Zakar, a dead planet. Shortly after that, Zohl requested help from a spirit that creates life, Aurora Rimaea. Aurora Rimaea is the Spirit of Mother Nature and Life itself and was able to give life to Planet Hetra, including humans.

This Runic Spell helps regulate and balance the natural order of a perfect sphere. But what does this spell regulate? Here's what it does and why Zohl made Planet Hetra a spheroid. Zohl doesn't really care much about physics and scientific numbers. He just creates based off of vibes alone.

It is composed of three main materials; a single Hexicule Core, Hardwood, and Stonewood. The Hexicule Core keeps the tree intact within the ground, serves as a light beacon, is nearly indestructible, and can regenerate its roots and wood when damaged. The Oakgnar Grand Tree is a symbolism where all the four corners of Hetra (earth) bind together where people are unified despite absolute differences of each other. A worldwide cultural festival will be held a month, yearly, celebrating life and enjoying it to the fullest. The Oakgnar Grand Tree stands as tall as Everest. It still stands to this day!
