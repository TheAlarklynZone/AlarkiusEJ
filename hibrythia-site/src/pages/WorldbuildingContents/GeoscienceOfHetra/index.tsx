              Hexicules vary greatly in size. Small ones are often shaped like a heart; larger ones can reach nearly the size of a drawer.

              Hetranium Crystals are <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">uncommon</strong> and scattered across Hetra — found on land, in oceans, and deep within seas. They are immediately recognizable by their <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">glowing orange color</strong> and distinctive geometry: sharp, jagged edges paired with unusually flat surfaces.

              Hetranium comes in <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">three different shapes and sizes</strong>, though all share the same sharp-flat composition. Their glow is faint in daylight but vivid in darkness, making them useful as natural markers in deep cave systems.

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85]">
              Hetranium is primarily valued in <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">navigation and architecture</strong>. Their natural luminosity makes them popular for lining underground passages, pathways, and structural pillars in areas where light sources are scarce.

              Vesselyte&apos;s most notable trait is its interaction with living beings.

            <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] leading-[1.85] mb-4">
              In everyday, non-biological use, Vesselyte functions as a <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">high-capacity energy storage and transfer medium</strong> — prized by engineers who need stable, long-duration energy containment.

              These crystals thrive exclusively in <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">cold and dark environments</strong>. Attempts to cultivate them outside the Stygian Realm have failed consistently, making supply limited and their value exceptionally high.
