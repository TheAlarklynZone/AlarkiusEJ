            The ancient Hetranian monks and astrologists who attempted to breach the Dream Dimension encountered barriers composed of stabilized Quwarkels. These Quwarkel structures maintain the separation between dimensional planes. Successful interdimensional travel would require the ability to manipulate Quwarkels themselves&mdash;a technology that remains beyond reach even in the current era.

          Early days and ancient years on Hetra, historians and astrologists of that time have discovered the dreams are a dimensional plane. A plane that holds the possibility of different universes, parallel realities, and potentially, the existence of the Multiverse. Dreams in this world, are the prime keys to unlocking the the gates of the Multiverse, but the primitive technology at that time was inefficient. And even to this day, it&apos;s still impossible.

          The astrologists of that time had their spiritual awareness, for most of them were monks. They&apos;ve used their affinity and power to try and lucid-dream and walk into the potential infinite possibilities of the Dream Dimension, but fails to do so, because of a strange barrier.

              Queen Laeyana is a Lhumerial, a being that exists within the 10-D, and is the Queen of all Magic. Laeyana can take on as many forms as she pleases, and often times gifts individuals with the power of magic (or a specific type of magic). There is also a high chance that when a baby is of before birth, she will bestow them with magic, giving a unique ability before being born into the world. Laeyana is a powerful, magic Lhumeria.

Around the world, there are Staff Altars that have a symbol and a plaque that symbolizes the presence of Queen Laeyana. Some have encountered Staff Altars, and sometimes will gain magic powers if they touch it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;this is an example of how magic can manifest onto someone through external sources.

The King fears that if he creates a spirit with all the 3 omnis, their personality will become twisted and thus turning them into Sphouls.
