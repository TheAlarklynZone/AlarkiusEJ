          Before the advances of technology of 1565 AD, people used to walk long miles because it was regarded as a healthy way of exercise, through the help of horses, Buffalosaurus Ants, and of the sort. But even with the huge time frame of 32 hours, walking or transportation via Beast Creatures wasn&apos;t enough. In fact, it wasn&apos;t efficient it&apos;s max, even with the help of tame beasts.

          The lands are vast and large, and taking trip to different areas, especially on the continents of Rynel and Varleqe — would take too long of a time. The technology before 1565 was at it&apos;s own absolute peak, using steam engines and steam punk technology. That Era was known as the <span className="text-[#f2ebeb] font-semibold">Steampunk Era</span>, which lasted from 3 AD - 1500 AD.

The Hexicule energy market is one of Hetra&apos;s most dominant industries — engineers and artificers have spent centuries trying to minimize energy loss during modification with only marginal success. Hexicules are also great stabilizers.

          Built within the year of <span className="text-[#f2ebeb] font-semibold">2124 AD</span> to combat the nasty ever-growing chaos above the ocean&apos;s surface. Long magnetic rails are built around the ocean floor of each continent, extending out to different regions and places around the globe. The UOTA departs from New Rynels&apos; Underground Station.

          The UOTA has <span className="text-[#f2ebeb] font-semibold">5 Aquasubs and lines</span>. One — the <span className="text-[#f2ebeb] font-semibold">UOTA-Shipment</span> — is used for importing and exporting goods. The other four lines are transit systems for the people of Hetra. The UOTA-Shipment goes up to the same speed as the ATI-Express.

          The magnetic suspension rails are built with <span className="text-[#f2ebeb] font-semibold">Hardwood Lucid Metal</span> with lines of Hexicules inside, which powers the suspension and hover mechanic of these trains. Hardwood Lucid Metal are wood-type metals found on the Continent of Norrane in cave systems — non-corrosive, non-rusting, and waterproof. These rails run on stable ground away from trenches, cliffsides, and anything that might crumble over time, underwater.
