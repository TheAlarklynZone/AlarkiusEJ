          <p>At the start of the creation of Planet Hetra, once water and life was filled, there was once a massive continent that almost took up the planet&apos;s body. It stuck out of the water itself. Zohl had named this continent, Greungeria, the grand continent of its era. There were many wildlife here including different kinds of beasts, direosaurus wolves, dinosaurs, dragons....etc. Before the humans came, there were Five Giants.</p>
          <p>These Giants once held massive knowledge of Queen Laeyana&apos;s Magic, as they were the forefathers that govern each type of magic:</p>

          <p>It took nearly 200 years for the continents to settle into the current shape Modern Hetra stands on, but they didn&apos;t drift into place. The landmasses were violently displaced and and settled due to traces of hexicules within the lower mantles of crust, which caused it to become hyperactive (and cooling down significantly). But it wasn&apos;t as dangerous as it was compared to hexicule storms because The 5 Giants lived in this area and helped rebuild ancient civilization from the ground up even after the continental drift.</p>

        <div className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>In the Year of 15 AD, a huge war ensued over parts of the world. There were too many Sylphs which upset the balance of nhuemyn kind alike, and the Elves were the ones that started this genocide. Since Vivianya lived back in the past, her protection faded away for the Sylph Race after she had passed. A lot of conflict rose to war, which made the Elves more hasty and effective at their ways of hunting and killing. They&apos;re accusatory, volatile, and menaces. The Elves nearly killed 50% of the Sylph Population which was enough to cause fear into them. The remaining 50% went into hiding.</p>
          <p>Even during the active onslaught, two Sylph Representatives by the name Krentyl and Fahlia called up Queen Laeyana by accessing her Staff Altar out in the wilderness. They complained about the war and asked to be relocated somewhere safe, or, a new realm to reside in. Laeyana had huge pity for the Sylph Race. So she summoned Zohl, Aurora Rimaea, and Aloria to discuss what should happen, since Zohl was the one who made Planet Hetra along side with Aloria (with Rimaea being The Spirit of Life).</p>
        </div>
        <blockquote className="border-l-2 border-[#c9a84c] pl-5 py-1">
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c9a84c] italic">"I&apos;m not creating a new planet. I don&apos;t want to govern another responsibility while I have this one." — Zohl, politely refusing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Rimaea was officially retired from creating life (Unless asked). But Fahlia and Krentyl insisted. The Elves threatened their very existence.</p>
          <p>But Laeyana had an idea. Instead of asking Zohl and Rimaea, she handpicked out a Spirit from the Divine Realm to shoulder a new chapter. Her name was Nahfia, and her Role? She is the Spirit of Sylphs. The guardian and creator of all. Rimaea asked if Nafhia wanted the line and Creation Tether for the Sylph Race, and she obliged. She took it as her own and all ancestral DNA from the Sylph Line now resides in Nahfia.</p>

            now has creation powers. Since she isn&apos;t originally a Celestriax or a Lyeceriax, she has both of those Spirit Typing Powers. She wanted to do something nice for the Sylph Line, so instead of keeping them on Hetra, she created habitable formations in space. She calls this place The Sylphrelm, or The Cloud Abode.</p>
          <p>This place, however, is not round like Planet Hetra, nor does it spin on its axis, or revolve around a star. It is a flat, asteroid-like mass that has a top surface with a gravitational pull, similar to that of Hetra, which keeps the citizens and cities from floating into space. Even though the gravity keeps everything at bay, there is a huge round bubble like shield that envelops the entire mass, which helps give sunlight, air, and many other mystical properties.</p>
          <p>Thus, all the Sylphs from Hetra moved to the Sylphrelm.</p>

Empowering, with driving rhythm and dark, echoing reverb that feels ancient and otherworldly. Heavy, ritualistic instrumentation: deep drums, staccato strings, tribal percussion. Set in a beautiful vicious time. Feels mountainous and raw. Played near the beautiful mountains. Vocal Style: Fierce, raw, guttural lows with soaring, aggressive highs. Strong vibrato on sustained notes.",

            <p>This Chant isn&apos;t about manipulation or topping over foes. It&apos;s about not giving into the deepest pits where you can&apos;t recover from. This is about Courage and Self Esteem. This is sung using the dialect of Demons, Varnæn, which is known as Demonic Ghrenglish back in the World of Greungeria. The first case of this song was often used by Demons at first, but the meaning stuck well so much, it spread to other cultures. This song however, is hated by{" "}

              who break the very codes and meaning of this piece.</p>
            <p>The Demon Race in this world isn&apos;t really frowned upon. Other cultures view them with respectful autonomy because they&apos;re not demonic. They&apos;re beautiful creatures that have the ability to understand others even past those surface-level rumors and stereotypes.</p>
            <p>Other cultures view this chant as demonic since it relies heavily on the Varnæn dialect and since it came from the demons themselves. But don&apos;t be fooled. This song is well respected among other beast life who have the capability to understand demon language along with Sylphic Ghrenglish (Aeþerlen Dialect).</p>

          <p><span className="italic">Hnthé Nhá Vaar</span> remains a living idiom used worldwide in Hetra, despite the fall of Ghrenglish. It evokes nostalgia and spiritual calm.</p>
          <p>(hen - the / nha / faar)</p>
          <p>Hnthé Nhá Vaar is a worldwide slang and phrase in the world of Hetra. It translates to: "It&apos;s never far from Home" — "Hnthé Nhá Vaar" was apart of the ancient Hetranian language from 145 Oldendaye before everything became English in 1568 Aftendaye. People around the world seem to have kept the only ancient slang as-is because it sounds nostalgic and brings peace. The world dubs this as its only ancient language to keep it as original as possible. Some of the locals have also turned this phrase into a soundtrack-like theme for it.</p>

        <div className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Modern Hetranian English developed as a natural evolution from Ancient Ghrenglish, carrying with it a blend of refined Latinic clarity and the melodic casualness reminiscent of Australian English. As a result, the dialect is recognized by:</p>
        </div>
        <ul className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-1.5 ml-5 list-disc">
          <li>Smooth yet informal intonation, with rising sentence endings in casual speech</li>
          <li>Use of abbreviated contractions, blended vowels, and occasional glottal stops</li>
          <li>Latin-rooted structure in formal, legal, or divine language, especially among the educated or religious classes.</li>
        </ul>
        <div className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
          <p>This unique fusion gives Hetranian English a tone that feels both ancient and approachable, used widely across all continents of Hetra. The decline of Ancient Ghrenglish began gradually after the fragmentation of the Greungerian supercontinent and the cultural dispersion of its people. As regional dialects like Aeþerlen and Varnæn fractured further, linguistic divergence increased.</p>
          <p>Between 1000 and 650 Oldendaye, formal use of Ghrenglish began to fade from everyday speech and was relegated to sacred texts, arcane rituals, and high literature. By 1568 Aftendaye, after the global standardization of education and political alliances between major continents, a newer form of streamlined, modern Hetranian English took hold.</p>
          <p>Certain phonetic forms, roots, and idioms (especially in blessings, place names, and noble titles) still retain Ghrenglish resonance — most notably seen in:</p>
        </div>
        <ul className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba] space-y-1.5 ml-5 list-disc italic">
          <li>Ritual phrases like Hnthé Nhá Vaar</li>
          <li>Divine names such as Zohl, Zephas, and Maezja</li>
          <li>Ceremonial titles like Zho&apos;haen and Thovanné</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="font-body text-sm text-[#c8c2ba]">This linguistic transition was not only organic but also symbolic — marking the end of the Divine Era and the rise of mortal civilizations across Hetra.</p>
