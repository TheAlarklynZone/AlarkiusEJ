          The Story goes like this&hellip;
        </h2>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          The story about the Midwinter Festival dates back to a long time ago. It happened on the Alarctic Alpines, before it was covered in snow, where a kingdom once reigned over the whole world before everything went awry.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          In the ancient past, a prominent figure by the name of Eira Valthorne was a queen for The Kingdom of Valthorne, which was named after her. She was a powerful queen bestowed with ice powers like no other. Her heart was said to be carved from a shard of eternal winter, along with her crown that was woven from moonlight and blackfrost. Although her dominion was cold and bitter, she kept balance, silencing the storms and guarding the land from hexicule showers. She was a defender for the world until one day.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          She tragically vanished on one midwinter&apos;s eve. Some say that she disappeared into the earth in the far south, while others say she died due to a strange illness. Other legends would say she was betrayed and was shattered into unfathomable counts of snowflakes, although that is up to interpretation.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          After Queen Eira&apos;s disappearance, the people wanted to remember her, so they began the <em>Midwinter Festival</em>. It is meant to be a sacred observance cloaked in boisterous behavior. Townsfolk would craft Frostblooms, which are crystalline flowers made from ice, bluebloom flowers, and enchanted herbs. These pretty crystals are placed in windows to guide her spirit home!
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          She was a feared queen, but people also respected her because of her impact on the world, so that&apos;s why on the 55th day, people recognize it as the day the Queen vanished. Although the people still do that, the festival still happens! Food is prepared not just for the people, but also for her spirit, as she enjoyed food and eating with her kingdom.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Not only is it called The Midwinter Festival, it&apos;s also called &ldquo;Queen Eira&apos;s Festival.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          At the end of the day, a blue bonfire is lit to help her pass on peacefully.

          These Crystals are mainly comprised of Crystalline Flowers made from Ice, Bluebloom Flowers, and enchanted herbs. The Bluebloom Flowers have this particular dye that emits very softly at night, with a blue fire light inside a lantern.

          A mold is given which is the exact shape of the Bluebloom Flower where water is poured so that it can cool down to take shape. Easily taken out.
