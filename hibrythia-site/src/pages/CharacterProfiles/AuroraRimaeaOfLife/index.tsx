            In the early days of the Divine Realm, after King Nhavah had established the Spirits of Creation and defined the roles of Celestriax and Lyeceriax, he turned his attention toward something fundamental, something that the universe, and every world within it, would desperately need.

            When it came time to give Hetra a direwolf lineage, Zohl asked <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Runerus, the Earlywulf Spirit</strong>, to create the Direosaurous Wolf as a predecessor for future direwolf generations.

When the two met for the first time, there was an immediate understanding between them. They were not enemies despite being cosmic "rivals." Instead, they were <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">two halves of the same eternal truth</strong>: life and death, creation and transition, beginning and ending.
