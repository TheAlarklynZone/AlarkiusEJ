        <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          <p>Before a life that was given full awakening, Rachnaea was once a beast creature, a demon witch, that lived by her own standards. In her prime days, she lived on the supercontinent of Varleqe, and she was a kind of a lesser demon that could evolve into a Demon Witch. She has a bewildering and stunning hourglass figure and wears gold-like bronze armor. She has two horns that stick out of her ears and pink-like horns as ears.</p>
          <p className="text-[#6b6560] italic">(Around this time, Demons are classified as Rank 1. No. 2 within the Beast Hierarchy System, as the possess power like no other)</p>
          <p>Even as a demon, they give a lot of attitude and sass, because all demons have some sort of similar trait. For Rachnaea though, she gives the most sassy and nasty behavior, long with a very short control of temper and anger. Even the little most things will make her become ill-tempered, and she does not like rules. Everything has to go into her exact order. She has a hunger for power and strives to stay among the sub-ranks of No.2 because demons themselves also compete for power and ranking.</p>
          <p>She was created in the year of 0055 AD from the demon grandfather, Khalfvyskov, on the Fifth Month of Escael, on the 5th Day. Demons in this world like the number 5 in iteration and sequence. 05/05/0055 AD.</p>
          <p>Her current age as of current year of 2245 is of 79,981 days old (2190 years).</p>

        <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          <p>After all hell broke loose on a neighboring continent called Hetrania, Zohl&apos;s rogue clone named Naele fled and flew to Varleqe. It was at this point he found a creature to his liking without caution and merged with it. But little did he know, he became one with a demon, which was Rachnaea. He tried to escape but couldn&apos;t due to her huge influence over control. He was forced to allow her to speak, and he had no choice to submit to her greedy nature. It was also during this time he gave her the ability to converse in English.</p>
          <p>As this happened, Zohl was trying to track down Naele, only to be surprised that Naele was working with Rachnaea, forcibly. He wanted help, asking to flee from the witch, but Zohl had doubts even when fighting the witch. She manipulated Naele&apos;s energy and took it as her own, only to make him suffer even more.</p>
          <p>When Zohl and his group fought her, the bond within Naele and Rachnaea was too powerful to cut down. Not only her power was stronger than the group, her grip and willpower of greed was too much for Naele, along with Zohl&apos;s team. So they had to retreat back to their hideout, to find a plan to take down Rachnaea.</p>
        </div>

        <p className="font-display text-sm text-[#6b6560] mt-8 mb-4">Sometime later&hellip;.</p>

        <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          <p>She laid siege on a town called Amberwick, which is said to house powerful mage books from the ancient past. Upon studying those books in an underground ruin, she taught herself the ability to use magic, and also, witchcraft. With more insane powers, she can negate magic attacks of any kind from any magic based opponent. During the studying of magic, she found herself a pink-gradient bone like crown and wore it on her head, which signifies her as &ldquo;Queen.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Amberwick is a name of a town on the Continent of Lynneria. She only seiged that town and nowhere else because of the ancient magic texts.</p>
          <p>After her success with magic and witchcraft, she later caused bloodshed, having the Amberieans do slave work for her. People inferior, or if they do bad stuff or rebel against her, will get slaughtered. She uses those blood to later evolve into a full Demon Witch</p>
          <p>Queen Rachnaea, now with her newfound powers, decided it was best to ramp up the siege in the continent of Lynneria. There were many waves of sieges throughout decades and eons. She summoned her minions and sieged the town, taking control. Every citizen there was made a slave, including the mayor of the town.</p>
          <p>Almost all the newborns and children had to acclimate to Rachnaea&apos;s order.</p>
          <p>This has been going on for years, decades, and even centuries. With the amount of bloodshed even prior to her evolution into a Full Demon Witch, she grew more in power. And during that time, she saw Naele as inferior and leeched his power from him even more, with him trying to survive. An abusive authority over power between her and Naele, sparked huge controversies with each other. However, Naele could not comprehend Rachnaea&apos;s full demon authority, and he had to succumb to it.</p>
          <p>When the year of 2245 came, Rachnaea sensed a chilling powerful enemy far out. She thought she was the only one gained with power and divine gifts, but she was wrong.</p>
          <p>To who was that foe of Rachnaea? That foe, so to say, is Kydel. As his presence moved around everywhere, every beast could sense it, including Rachnaea, from miles away. When Kydel heard of the disturbance of Rachnaea&apos;s siege from the city of Grelladore (in Nharvenile), he decided it was time to take on an opponent in Amberwick, which was her. With Rachnaea awaiting for Kydel&apos;s arrival, she was nervous and afraid. She wanted to flee, but she couldn&apos;t. Once Kydel arrived at the devastated look of Amberwick, he questioned Rachnaea before they battled. Kydel emerged victorious, killing Rachnaea.</p>
          <p>However, this all changed when a certain someone offered her a better life later down the road after her &ldquo;revival.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Rachnaea is a sassy, cunning, and a devilish demon. She holds her pride up high and will not allow others to bring her down. She is hungry for power and will do anything to gain immense entitlement, either through bloodshed or worse. Her hunger for power and to remain the most powerful creature stays the same.</p>
          <p>Rachnaea has a human appearance, but she doesn&apos;t use it as often. She only uses it if she wants to blend in with actual humans to go shop or steal items from stores or big name brands. When she is in her human form, her appearance age is at 30.</p>

            <p>Having studied magic, she has gained the knowledge to turn into a human where she can fit in with others. She does this so she can go shopping for materials or food. Rachnaea knows having to make siege requires money, thus, she goes about in her human form and shops for strange&hellip;..items. People who notice her alluring laidback presence will always ask her to repair their rooftiles or help build. Because of this soft and heart-warming quality that humans give off, she was slightly influenced, which made her a little fond of them. Her human name is Neah.</p>

Rachnaea hasn&apos;t even tapped into her full potential yet. She held back strictly (unaware) when she fought Zohl, Raeya, and Kydel, because deep down, she wanted this cycle of hatred to end. But instead, she ignored that.</p>

        <div className="space-y-4 font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          <p>Rachnaea has three weaknesses. Two of them are easy enough to exploit and one is a bit harder, but exploitable.</p>
          <p>One of them is her tail. Rachnaea&apos;s tail is sensitive to touch and is fragile against ice. Although she hides it in plain sight, it still makes her vulnerable if someone approaches her from behind and tries to subdue her. When her tail is exposed or touched by bare hands, her body aches and contracts for around five minutes, disabling her movements.</p>
          <p>The second weakness of Rachnaea are her wings. Ice is one of the weaknesses when it comes to flying. There is a twist to this though. If she gets hit with <span className="text-[#f2ebeb]">Ice</span>, she cannot fly, at all.</p>
          <p>The third weakness of all, which is the hardest one to achieve in defeating Rachnaea is.....Naele.</p>
          <p>Naele is a spirit host, bound to Rachnaea, also a clone of Zohl. In order to defeat Rachnaea, Naele needs to be separated from her, through the help of Zohl. Rachnaea states that she is defenseless and powerless if Naele is not there with her. Although she was defeated by Kydel later and after the death of Naele, she kept these powers because of her level of authority over energy signatures, which later become one with her.</p>
