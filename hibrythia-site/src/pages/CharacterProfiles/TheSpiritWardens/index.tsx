          One of Zohl&apos;s tasks was to create a Spiritqual, a cave or den that is powerful enough to be indestructible and can house spirits. After that, he cloned himself 12 times, all perfect clones with their own mindset and personality. The Spiritqual is located in an underground cave, on the floating continent, Hetrania.

          The Spirit Wardens&apos; forms are configured by Zohl. The Wardens have an appearance of an Amulet Necklace. However, this form is their only one. The Spirit Wardens has the same powers as Zohl&apos;s Pendant Powers.

          Each of these clones&apos; amulet are coded with different colors in the color spectrum that Zohl had configured. They also know Zohl as the original Spirit. Zohl&apos;s spirit color is Divine Orange. However, the warden spirits lose their divinity.

          Zohl then named his clones as the Spirit Wardens. Zohl tasked them to guard the Spiritqual from potential threats or just invaders. But if one ever chose to come near, the clone will have to choose the individual as a Hibryd.

          These powers that Leon have is focused mainly on dexterity and also the animal symbolism. Much like how Aloria Cloudwave&apos;s powers are! (Rein took inspiration from her).

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          After a few decades on Hetra, one Warden went rogue and almost caused damage to the Spiritqual. That Warden was Naele. However, the rest of the Wardens stopped Naele. But after a short duration of time, Naele escaped out into the vast world of Hetra in his amulet form.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Obviously, the rest of the Wardens reported back to Zohl, which made him extremely upset. Zohl called up Rein who was with Leon, and asked them if they had seen Naele. But to their surprise, both Leon and Rein didn&apos;t know where Naele went. So in a group, the Wardens along with Leon and Zohl searched for Naele. Cal was the one who found Naele, but they were too late.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Naele unfortunately bonded with someone he thought was an actual spider, BUT he was wrong! He bonded with a Demon Witch named Rachnaea (her name confused him because it sounds like a spider&apos;s name).
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          Rachnaea&apos;s <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">demon heart</strong> poisoned Naele, but he didn&apos;t care one bit. Cal, Zohl, Rein, along with Leon tried to stop Naele and Rachnaea, but they were too strong together. So Cal, along with the others, went back to the Spiritqual to brainstorm ways to take down this said opponent. They had no options, so they had to wait to find and anoint a Hibryd. Even Leon wasn&apos;t powerful enough to take down the demon witch.

          Many millennia, quincentenaries&apos;, and decades later, it became the year 2245. On the fifth month in the summer, Leon was getting old and Rein can&apos;t continue without a new host. However, he can merge back with Zohl if Zohl needed his clones to fuse back together. Zohl who was here on Hetrania sensed a very noble and kind heart heading its way towards the island, so Zohl asked his current clones to gather up.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          The plan was to anoint the upcoming being as a Hibryd, and after the hibryd wakes up, Leon will pass on his inheritance to said hibryd, along with some new powers. Yes, you&apos;re thinking correctly. That Hibryd was Kydel — a <em>pawn</em> for Zohl&apos;s plan to right his wrong doings from the ancient past with Naele and Rachnaea.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">

        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          After the plan was set, Zohl chose four of his clones to merge back with him, since his power was weaker after he cloned himself.
