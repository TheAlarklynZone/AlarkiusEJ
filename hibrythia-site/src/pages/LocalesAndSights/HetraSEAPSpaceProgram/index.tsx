          The <strong>Hetranian Space Exploration &amp; Aeronautics Program</strong>, commonly known as <strong>HetraS.E.A.P</strong>, is the leading interplanetary space agency of Planet Hetra. Headquartered in the city of <strong>New Rynels</strong> on the continent of Rynel, HetraSEAP operates as a government-funded program responsible for the exploration and documentation of the <strong>Nhumela Cluster</strong>, the home solar system of Planet Hetra.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          With access to cutting-edge technology and close collaboration with scientific institutions, most notably the scientists of <strong>Eldreule</strong> (City of Science, Lynneria), HetraSEAP has been central to normalizing space travel across the solar system. As of the current year <strong>2245 A.D.</strong>, interplanetary transportation between Hetra and its neighboring inhabited planet, <strong>Planet Schavel</strong>, is a routine part of life.

          New Rynels is the largest coastline city on Planet Hetra and is considered the economic and infrastructural capital of the world. Its vast wealth (home to individuals with net-worths reaching into the quadrillions) and its concentration of entrepreneurs, engineers, and high-paying institutions made it the natural home of HetraSEAP. The city&apos;s resources and global reach allow HetraSEAP to fund large-scale missions with consistent backing.

            The origins of HetraSEAP trace back to Hetra&apos;s <strong>First Space Age</strong>, founded in 1975, a period of explosive technological growth that preceded the Year 2000. As Hetra&apos;s global civilization advanced, the scientific community, led primarily by researchers from the City of <strong>Eldreule</strong> on the continent of Lynneria, began developing the technology necessary for interplanetary travel.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            As rocketry and propulsion science matured, the need for a centralized, government-level space agency became clear. HetraSEAP was formally established and funded through New Rynels, bringing together the brightest minds from across Hetra to pursue a singular mission:

            Space Exploration is currently confined in the Nhumela Cluster because the fuel is only limited to this range. However, HetraSEAP has sent long range missions deep into space with rocket satellites to explore more of the outer known. Camera Rocket Satellites have been sent further, which only uses the power of solar light to travel around further in the great unknown. Most of these satellites are named after the names of the calendar.

          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            The most monumental milestone in HetraSEAP&apos;s history was the <strong>First Schavel Expedition</strong> in Hetra Year 2000. Scientists from Eldreule partnered directly with HetraSEAP to launch the first crewed mission to <strong>Planet Schavel</strong>, a rogue planet that had drifted into the Nhumela Cluster and was placed on the solar system&apos;s vertical orbital axis by the Spirit of Creation, <strong>Zohl</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            Schavel had already developed native animal life prior to the expedition, which made the mission significantly more viable. The first crew successfully landed, made contact with the planet&apos;s environment, and laid the groundwork for future visits.

          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            Over the following decade, HetraSEAP dedicated intensive research missions to Schavel. Among the primary objectives were:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-2">
            <li className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed"><strong>Documenting the planet&apos;s time system:</strong> Schavel operates on a 540-day year with 15 months of 36 days each, a notably different system from Hetra&apos;s 444-day year.</li>
            <li className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed"><strong>Adapting Hetra&apos;s 32/16 hour system</strong> to Schavel, given that the planets share nearly identical sizes and rotational speeds.</li>
            <li className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed"><strong>Mapping the planet&apos;s geography,</strong> ecosystems, and atmospheric conditions.</li>
            <li className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed"><strong>Studying Moon Scavnar,</strong> Schavel&apos;s companion moon, a former comet that now maintains the planet&apos;s perfect spherical shape through its magnetic and orbital field.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            By the end of this period, Schavel had been fully named and documented, and the first wave of Hetranian emigrants began settling on the planet.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            When Schavel falls through the horizontal orbit, it meets Hetra at a safe distance where the planet can be seen from the surface of Hetra and Schavel itself. The gravitational waves between these two planets will not interfere with each other because the distance is greater in the goldilocks zone.
          </p>
          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            In some regions of the green zone and at a certain point in time, Planet Schavel will meet closely with Hetra without causing any gravitational disturbance. You can see Schavel up close with the naked eye when the time comes.

            Following the success of the Schavel expeditions, including CalderiaX and GristelZ1A, HetraSEAP oversaw the development of commercial and civilian space travel. The journey between Hetra and Schavel takes approximately <strong>two days</strong>, and a standard time adjustment period is required upon arrival due to the difference in planetary time systems. There is also a Space Tour.

          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
            Today, the population of Hetranian-born citizens living on Schavel is significant enough that a distinct cultural identity has formed. People who live on Schavel are known as <strong>&ldquo;Schavelia-Hetrans.&rdquo;</strong> HetraSEAP continues to manage and oversee the routes, safety protocols, and scientific monitoring of all interplanetary travel.

          This fun space activity was implemented in the year 2150 AD. It uses Lhureanium as a source of renewable fuel and energy. This fuel is a special kind bio-chemical that is used for Hyperspace Travels and for these kinds of space tours. Lhureanium uses a mix of hexicules, lunar energy, plasma, and Vesselyte Crystals.

          Hetranians and also Schavelia-Hetrans will need to make a reservation to book a ticket which costs <strong>75.85 Hetrix Dollars</strong>. Schavelia-Hetrans will need to emigrate back to Hetra for this tour, since Planet Schavel doesn&apos;t have nearly as enough resources as Hetra. Don&apos;t worry, people make it in time for this. There&apos;s a huge window before the liftoff.

          A Spaceship is prepared in The Gulf of New Rynels, where a massive platform floats on the water. This ship is called the <strong>United Hetral Shuttle Spaceship</strong>, or the <strong>UHSS</strong>. It will take you on a massive tour of the Nhumela Cluster using a stable drive. There are multiple checkpoints within the solar system which allows the ship to halt. There is a sundeck on this ship that you can view the open space from within.
