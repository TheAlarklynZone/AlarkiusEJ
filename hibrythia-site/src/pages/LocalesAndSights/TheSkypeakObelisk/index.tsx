        <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed">
          The Skypeak Obelisk serves as a Fantasy-Video game-like system where you can farm actual ExP Points to help better and improve your powers, including gold. There are also unique housing systems that you can purchase and live within. Among these floors, there are quests, party systems, PVP, battling systems, and boss fights. A lot of citizens from around the world come to this very place to have fun.

          The building can fit at least <strong className="text-[#f2ebeb]">2.3 million individuals</strong> at one time because of how huge its size is &mdash; making it one of the most economically active single locations on the entire planet. The building itself has over millions of windows that are made out of hexicules, which is stronger than diamond and a lot of other materials. There&apos;s an entrance near the bottom where flying cars can exit and enter. Billboards float around the area and blimps, the size of the building&apos;s windows.

          The Skypeak Obelisk operates on Hexicules. Hexicules are magic crystals that help serve as a fundamental core when it comes to buildings or inventions. They can be used as a variety of things, like batteries, engines, and technological inventions.

            The Skypeak Obelisk is unlike any other attraction on Planet Hetra. It operates as an entirely self-contained world within a world.
