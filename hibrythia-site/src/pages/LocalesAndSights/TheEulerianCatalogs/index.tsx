          One of the Seven Wonders of The World. A giant underground library stretching from the Eulan Kingdom to the Oelen Kingdom.
          Its architecture has been dated to 235 Oldendaye. Built for Giants. Books of all sizes, different aisles, and magic books.
          Texts on Eulerian Martial Arts and Hethurgism. Open to the public. Surface entrance found at the Euriel Town ruins (Euriel Ruins).
          Closes during the Month of Mulumber and Griselmber due to heavy snowstorms.

          <p className="font-body text-base text-[#c8c2ba] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Hethurgism is an ancient martial arts originating in the Greungerian Era. Invented by humans who trained under the guidance
            of Faes and Beasts. Unlike most combat systems, it is not energy-based &mdash; instead, it deals with physical pressure points,
            finds weak points in an opponent, and suppresses Aura within living beings. The closest Earth equivalent would be a combination
            of Wuxia Arts, Tai-Chi, and Japanese Aikido. It is a rare practice in modern times.

            The Eulerian Catalogs houses an extensive collection of magical items: spells, incantations, grimoires, tomes, and artifacts.
            Ancient weapons are present, though they are extremely fragile and must not be handled roughly. Decorative objects include
            a giant hammer that swings like Mjolnir, and a giant claymore said to have beheaded a giant demon dragon. Many objects
            once belonged to The 5 Giants of the Greungerian Era.
