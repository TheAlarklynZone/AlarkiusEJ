Finding jobs in Eulanis to work under the King and Queen is not a very hard task, because most locations will keep hiring despite other workers being laid off, or on vacation. There were many kings and queens in the past who rose to fame on Eulanis, but many of them died out either to old age or assassination attempts. One of the most famous assassinations happened in 450 OD (oldendaye): the Kulvera Attempt &mdash; orchestrated by Damien Kulvera to kill King Renton. This attempt needed the use of a rope, the Heimlich, a glass of water, and a gag. The Church of Hynnia sits here in this city.
